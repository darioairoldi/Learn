## üéØ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Root Cause
The workflow was using `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to create an intermediate artifact between the build and deploy jobs. This artifact counts against your GitHub Actions storage quota, which accumulates over time with each workflow run.

### Fix Applied
**Modified**: `.github/workflows/quarto-publish.win64.yml`

**Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ **Eliminated unnecessary intermediate artifact** - Removed the `upload-artifact@v4` step that was creating the "github-pages-build" artifact
2. ‚úÖ **Combined build and deploy into single job** - Simplified the workflow from 2 jobs to 1 job
3. ‚úÖ **Use GitHub Pages artifact directly** - Use `upload-pages-artifact@v3` which has separate storage quota
4. ‚úÖ **Deploy directly after upload** - No need to download artifact in separate job

**Before:**
```yaml
# Build job - uploads artifact
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: github-pages-build
    path: docs/

# Deploy job - downloads artifact
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: github-pages-build
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Single combined job
- uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: docs/
- uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ No more artifact storage quota issues
- ‚úÖ Faster workflow (single job instead of two)
- ‚úÖ Simpler maintenance
- ‚úÖ Follows GitHub Actions best practices for Pages deployment

## üßπ Cleanup Existing Artifacts

A PowerShell script has been created to clean up existing artifacts and old workflow runs:

**Script**: `cleanup-artifacts.ps1`

**To run:**
```powershell
cd "E:\dev.darioa.live\darioairoldi\Learn\20251018 ISSUE Github action fails with Artifact storage quota has been hit"
.\cleanup-artifacts.ps1
```

The script will:
1. Delete all existing artifacts
2. Delete old workflow runs (keeping the last 5)
3. Show current storage status

---

## üìã Manual Cleanup Commands (Reference)

If you prefer manual cleanup instead of using the script:

**List all artifacts:**<br>
```powershell
gh api repos/darioairoldi/Learn/actions/artifacts
```

**Delete specific artifact by ID:**<br>
```powershell
gh api repos/darioairoldi/Learn/actions/artifacts/ARTIFACT_ID -X DELETE
```

**Delete all artifacts:**<br>
```powershell
gh api repos/darioairoldi/Learn/actions/artifacts --paginate --jq ".artifacts[].id" | ForEach-Object { gh api repos/darioairoldi/Learn/actions/artifacts/$_ -X DELETE }
```

**List and delete workflow runs:**<br>
```powershell
gh run list --repo darioairoldi/Learn
gh run delete <run-id> --repo darioairoldi/Learn
```

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Workflow has been fixed** - The `.github/workflows/quarto-publish.win64.yml` file has been updated
2. üîÑ **Run the cleanup script** to remove existing artifacts and old workflow runs
   ```powershell
   .\cleanup-artifacts.ps1
   ```
3. üìù **Commit the updated workflow file** to your repository
4. üß™ **Test the workflow** by triggering it manually or pushing a commit
5. üìä **Monitor** - The new workflow should no longer create artifacts that count against your quota

---

## üìö Advanced Troubleshooting (If Issues Persist)

### Step 1: Check GitHub Billing Dashboard

Visit your billing page to see actual storage usage:

```powershell
# Open billing page in browser
start https://github.com/settings/billing
```

Look for:
- **Actions storage** usage amount
- Which repositories are consuming storage
- Any pending charges or limits

### Step 2: Check for Artifacts in ALL Repos (More Thorough)

```powershell
# Get detailed artifact info from all repos
gh repo list darioairoldi --limit 100 --json name,url | ConvertFrom-Json | ForEach-Object {
    $repo = $_.name
    Write-Host "`n=== Checking: $repo ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    $artifacts = gh api "repos/darioairoldi/$repo/actions/artifacts" --jq '.artifacts'
    if ($artifacts -ne '[]') {
        Write-Host "Found artifacts!" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        gh api "repos/darioairoldi/$repo/actions/artifacts" --jq '.artifacts[] | "\(.id) - \(.name) - \(.size_in_bytes) bytes"'
    } else {
        Write-Host "No artifacts" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Check Workflow Runs (They Might Hold References)

```powershell
# List recent workflow runs that might be holding artifact references
gh run list --repo darioairoldi/Learn --limit 20 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,createdAt
```

### Step 4: Delete Old Workflow Runs

Sometimes workflow runs themselves consume storage even after artifacts are deleted:

```powershell
# Delete all completed workflow runs (this can free up storage)
gh api repos/darioairoldi/Learn/actions/runs --paginate --jq '.workflow_runs[].id' | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "Deleting run: $_"
    gh api repos/darioairoldi/Learn/actions/runs/$_ -X DELETE
}
```


### Step 5: Contact GitHub Support

If none of the above works, this is likely a GitHub platform issue:

1. **Open a support ticket**: https://support.github.com/
2. **Check GitHub Status**: https://www.githubstatus.com/
3. **Community Forum**: https://github.community/

## üìù Resolution Timeline

### Actions Taken
- ‚úÖ **Analyzed the issue** - Identified artifact storage quota problem
- ‚úÖ **Fixed the workflow** - Eliminated unnecessary intermediate artifacts
- ‚úÖ **Created cleanup script** - Automated cleanup of existing artifacts and workflow runs
- üîÑ **Pending**: Run cleanup script and test new workflow

### What Changed
1. **Workflow file updated** - Combined build/deploy jobs, removed artifact step
2. **Cleanup script created** - `cleanup-artifacts.ps1` for removing old data
3. **Documentation updated** - This README now contains the complete solution

## üéì Key Learnings

**Problem**: Using `actions/upload-artifact@v4` for GitHub Pages deployment creates unnecessary artifacts that consume storage quota.

**Solution**: Use `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` directly, which:
- Has separate storage quota for GitHub Pages
- Is designed specifically for Pages deployment
- Automatically manages artifact lifecycle
- Simplifies workflow structure

**Best Practice**: For GitHub Pages deployments, always use the dedicated Pages actions instead of generic artifact actions.
