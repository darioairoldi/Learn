# Summary - GitHub Actions Artifact Storage Quota Issue

## ✅ SOLUTION COMPLETED

I've successfully analyzed and fixed your GitHub Actions artifact storage quota issue!

---

## 🔍 What Was The Problem?

Your workflow was using `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to create an intermediate artifact between the build and deploy jobs. These artifacts accumulate over time and count against your GitHub Actions storage quota, eventually causing the "Artifact storage quota has been hit" error.

**Workflow Structure (Before):**
```
┌─────────────┐     Upload Artifact     ┌──────────────┐
│  Build Job  │ ───────────────────────> │ Deploy Job   │
│             │   (quota consumed!)      │              │
│ • Render    │                          │ • Download   │
│ • Create    │                          │ • Deploy     │
│   artifact  │                          │   to Pages   │
└─────────────┘                          └──────────────┘
```

## ✨ The Fix

I've updated your workflow to eliminate the unnecessary intermediate artifact:

**Workflow Structure (After):**
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Build-and-Deploy Job        │
│                              │
│  • Render                    │
│  • Upload to Pages directly  │
│  • Deploy                    │
│                              │
│  (No quota consumption!)     │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Changes:**
1. ✅ Removed `actions/upload-artifact@v4` step
2. ✅ Removed `actions/download-artifact@v4` step
3. ✅ Combined build and deploy into single job
4. ✅ Use `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` directly (has separate quota!)

## 🚀 Next Steps (What You Need To Do)

### 1. Run the Cleanup Script
```powershell
cd "E:\dev.darioa.live\darioairoldi\Learn\20251018 ISSUE Github action fails with Artifact storage quota has been hit"
.\cleanup-artifacts.ps1
```

### 2. Commit the Fixed Workflow
```powershell
cd E:\dev.darioa.live\darioairoldi\Learn
git add .github/workflows/quarto-publish.win64.yml
git commit -m "Fix: Eliminate artifact storage quota issue"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Test the Workflow
- Go to: https://github.com/darioairoldi/Learn/actions
- Click "Run workflow" to test

---

## 📊 Expected Results

**Immediate:**
- ✅ Cleanup script removes all existing artifacts
- ✅ Cleanup script removes old workflow runs
- ✅ Storage quota starts to decrease (may take 6-12 hours to reflect)

**After First Run:**
- ✅ Workflow completes successfully
- ✅ No new artifacts created in the Artifacts section
- ✅ Site deployed to GitHub Pages
- ✅ No more quota errors!

---

## 🎯 Why This Works

**GitHub Pages Artifacts vs Regular Artifacts:**

| Type | Action | Quota Impact | Lifecycle |
|------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Regular Artifact | `upload-artifact@v4` | ❌ Counts against quota | Manual retention |
| Pages Artifact | `upload-pages-artifact@v3` | ✅ Separate quota | Auto-managed |

By using the dedicated GitHub Pages artifact action, you:
- Get automatic artifact lifecycle management
- Use a separate storage quota
- Follow GitHub's recommended best practices
- Simplify your workflow
