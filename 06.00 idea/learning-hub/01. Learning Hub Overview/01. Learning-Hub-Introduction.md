## 📖 Overview

The **Learning Hub** pursues a paradigm shift from traditional **passive information consumption** to <mark>**intelligent**, **automated** knowledge **development**</mark>. 

This tool transforms interaction with information by implementing <mark>**intelligent gathering**</mark>, <mark>**automated update and development**</mark> and <mark>**collaborative learning**</mark>.

### Core Transformation Principles

The Learning Hub changes learning from:

- **"Information sparse"** → **"<mark>Information centric</mark>"**
  Information is developed iteratively into the Learning hub, with help of Copilot.
  Copilot assists in gathering, curating and developing information, making it more accessible and actionable.

- **"Passive consumption"** → **"<mark>Active intelligent analysis and development</mark>"**
  The Learning Hub actively processes information, into the first creation and also into the development iterations.
  Learning hub assists in organizing information for readability, consistency... and also in identifying knowledge gaps and opportunities for further exploration.

- **"Random learning"** → **"<mark>Structured knowledge development</mark>"**
  Learning now progresses with the development of information. It doesn't stop at the first read.
- **"Individual learning"** → **"<mark>Collaborative learning</mark>"**
  Learning pieces can be exchanged and developed across learning hub instances and, of course, it can be developed starting from (public) web resources or user provided information.

### Intelligence Application Areas

Learning Hub applies structured intelligence to:

- **<mark>Information gathering</mark>** - Multi-channel automated collection
- **<mark>Information filtering</mark>** - AI-powered relevance scoring and prioritization
- **<mark>Information analysis</mark>** - Pattern recognition and insight extraction
