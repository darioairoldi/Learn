# Copilot Spaces Patterns

**Purpose**: Decision framework for when and how to use GitHub Copilot Spaces as a persistent context layer that complements repository-level customization files.

**Referenced by**: Agent files using cross-project context, orchestrator prompts referencing external knowledge, `.github/instructions/agents.instructions.md`

---

## What Spaces Are

A **Space** is a persistent, shareable container for context that lives at the **GitHub platform level** — independent of any single repository. Spaces don't replace repository-level files; they fill the gap for cross-project and ephemeral context.

> **Feature status**: Public preview (February 2026). Available with any Copilot license including Free tier.

## Space Content Types

| Content Type | Description | How Copilot Uses It |
|---|---|---|
| **Instructions** | Free-text guidance (Space-level `.instructions.md`) | Injected into system prompt |
| **Files & repos** | Code, docs from GitHub repos | Repo = searched; individual files = loaded fully |
| **Links** | URLs to PRs, issues, GitHub content | Fetches and references |
| **Uploads** | Local documents, images, spreadsheets | Loads into context window |
| **Text** | Pasted notes, transcripts, specs | Loads into context window |

**Key behavior**: Repository sources are **searched** (broad, large-scale). Individual files are **fully loaded** (precise, consistently prioritized). GitHub-based sources stay **automatically in sync** with the `main` branch.

## Where Spaces Fit in the Customization Stack

| Mechanism | Scope | Lives In | Persistence | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Prompt files | Project | Repository | Versioned | Reusable task templates |
| Instruction files | Project/path | Repository | Versioned | Coding standards |
| Agent files | Project | Repository | Versioned | Specialized roles |
| MCP servers | Project/global | Config files | Session | External tool access |
| **Copilot Spaces** | **Cross-project** | **GitHub platform** | **Persistent, shareable** | **Curated knowledge, onboarding, ephemeral context** |

## Decision Guide

```
Does this context belong in version control?
├── Yes → Use .instructions.md / .prompt.md / .agent.md
└── No → Does it need team sharing?
    ├── Yes → Copilot Spaces (org-owned)
    └── No → Copilot Spaces (personal) or .copilot/context/
```

**Quick rules:**
- Code conventions, project rules → `.instructions.md`
- Reusable tasks → `.prompt.md`
- External tools → MCP servers
- Cross-repo knowledge, onboarding, ephemeral docs → **Copilot Spaces**

## Three Combination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Space as Research + Repo as Execution
Space contains architecture docs, ADRs, design specs → grounds *what to build*.  
Repository instructions and agents → control *how to build*.

### Pattern 2: Space for Standards + Instructions for Conventions
Org-wide Space with coding standards, review checklists → baseline.  
Project `.instructions.md` → repo-specific conventions on top.

### Pattern 3: Space for Onboarding + Agents for Workflows
"Getting Started" Space curates documents for new devs.  
Project agents automate daily development workflows.

## IDE Access via MCP

Spaces require the **GitHub MCP server** with explicit toolset configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "X-MCP-Toolsets": "default,copilot_spaces"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **Agent mode only** in IDE (not ask or edit mode)
- Tools: `get_copilot_space`, `list_copilot_spaces` under MCP Server: github
- **IDE limitation**: Repository context within a Space isn't available from IDE — attach individual files instead

## Collaboration Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| **Viewer** | Use Space, ask questions, view sources |
| **Editor** | Update sources, name, instructions + Viewer |
| **Admin** | Update sharing, delete Space + Editor |

Personal Spaces can be shared publicly (view-only), with specific users, or kept private.

## Current Limitations

| Limitation | Workaround |
|---|---|
| IDE: no repo context in Spaces | Attach individual files, not repos |
| Agent mode only (IDE) | Switch to agent mode |
| No API for automation | Use GitHub web UI |
| Usage counts toward limits | Choose standard models for high-volume |

## Relationship to Prompt Assembly

Spaces inject context **alongside** the prompt assembly pipeline documented in [07-prompt-assembly-architecture.md](./07-prompt-assembly-architecture.md). Space instructions act like an additional system prompt layer; Space sources provide grounding context. They don't change the 6-layer system prompt structure — they extend it.
