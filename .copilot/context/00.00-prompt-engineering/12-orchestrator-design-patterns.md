# Orchestrator Design Patterns

**Purpose**: Decision framework for when and how to build multi-agent orchestrations, including the 9 design principles and subagent mechanics.

**Referenced by**: Orchestrator agents, multi-agent prompts, `.github/agents/*.agent.md` with `agents` property

---

## Architecture Tier Decision

```
Is the task multi-phase?
  NO → Single agent or prompt file
  YES ↓
Do phases need different tools?
  NO → Single agent with phased instructions
  YES ↓
Does context fill up within one session?
  NO → Single agent with clear phase markers
  YES ↓
Do you need quality gates between phases?
  NO → Subagents for context isolation only
  YES → Full orchestrator with handoffs + subagents
```

| Tier | Setup | When |
|------|-------|------|
| Single prompt | One `.prompt.md` | Simple, focused tasks |
| Single agent | One `.agent.md` with phases | Multi-step, same tools |
| Agent + subagents | Main agent spawning subagents | Context isolation, no checkpoints |
| Full orchestrator | Coordinator + specialists + handoffs | Complex, multi-phase, different tools |

## 9 Design Principles

1. **Start simple, add complexity when observed** — Don't begin with five specialists. Start with one agent. Add orchestration only for observed failures.
2. **Define roles by tools, not just instructions** — A reviewer with `edit` tools will eventually edit. Remove tools you don't want used.
3. **Design explicit handoff contracts** — Define **what** passes (structured format), **how much** (summaries, not raw data), **when** (explicit conditions).
4. **Set iteration limits early** — Three iterations of implement→review is usually sufficient. Unbounded loops are the most common failure.
5. **Prefer sequential over parallel by default** — Parallel is faster but harder to debug. Start sequential.
6. **Keep the orchestrator thin** — Coordinate, don't process. If orchestrator instructions exceed specialist instructions, you're doing too much.
7. **Plan for failure at every transition** — Every handoff can fail. Define: Retry, Escalate, Skip, or Abort.
8. **Validate before you build** — Use the Use Case Challenge before investing in multi-agent orchestration.
9. **Delegate goals, not solutions** — Orchestrator describes desired outcome; sub-agent decides how. Address **both sides**: orchestrator says *what* (goals, constraints, acceptance criteria), sub-agent gets counter-instruction: "Question everything you're told. Make your own decisions." Models naturally micromanage; you must explicitly prevent this.

## Four-Specialist Pattern

| Role | Tools | Model | Output |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Researcher** | `read`, `search`, `fetch`, `grep` | Standard (strong reasoning) | Structured summary |
| **Builder** | `edit`, `read`, `search`, `terminal` | Fast/cheap (Haiku, Flash) | Code changes |
| **Validator** | `read`, `terminal` | Fast/cheap | Pass/fail + details |
| **Reviewer** | `read`, `search`, `grep` | Standard (strong judgment) | Prioritized findings |

Start with minimum roles. Add specialists only when you observe role confusion.

## Use Case Challenge — 5 Questions

Before building an orchestrator, answer these:

1. **Complexity**: Can a single agent with good instructions handle this? (If yes, stop.)
2. **Role definition**: Can you describe each specialist’s role in one sentence? (If vague, decomposition is wrong.)
3. **Handoff clarity**: What exactly passes between phases — and is it structured?
4. **Failure handling**: What happens when a specialist fails or produces poor results?
5. **Value verification**: Does multi-agent measurably improve on single-agent?

## Subagent Mechanics

### `runSubagent` Tool

Enable via frontmatter: `tools: ['agent']` — alias for `runSubagent`.

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Context isolation | Clean context window—no inherited history |
| Synchronous | Main agent waits for result |
| Parallel support | Multiple subagents can run concurrently |
| Tool inheritance | Inherits main session tools by default |
| Custom override | Custom agent's tools/model/instructions override |
| Result format | Only final result returns, not intermediate calls |

### Controlling Subagent Access

```yaml
agents: ['Red', 'Green', 'Refactor']  # Only these allowed
agents: ['*']                          # All agents (default)
agents: []                             # No subagents
```

**Critical**: Listing an agent in `agents` array overrides `disable-model-invocation: true`.

### Visibility Configuration

| `user-invokable` | `disable-model-invocation` | Result |
|:---:|:---:|---|
| true | false | Full access — user and agents |
| true | true | User-only — protected from auto-invocation |
| false | false | Subagent-only — hidden from user |
| false | true | Locked — only via explicit `agents` array |

## Execution Flow Control

| Control | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Implement → Review cycle | Max 3 iterations |
| Research → Plan refinement | Max 2 iterations |
| Overall workflow | Max 5 specialist invocations |
| Orchestration depth | Max 1 (orchestrator → specialist, never deeper) |
| Recursion prevention | `agents: []` + `disable-model-invocation: true` on specialists |

**Error handling:**

| Scenario | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Empty result | Retry once with diagnostic prompt |
| Contradicts plan | Present both perspectives to user |
| Tool failure | Log error, try alternative approach |
| Context exhausted | Summarize progress, start new session |

## Model Selection for Subagents

| Task Type | Model Tier | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Architecture, planning | High (Sonnet, Opus) | Strong reasoning needed |
| Code implementation | Medium (Haiku, Flash) | Well-defined, faster |
| Linting, formatting | Low (fastest) | Mechanical, rule-based |
| Research, summarization | Medium-High | Comprehension, not creativity |

Specify `model:` array in specialist frontmatter — VS Code tries each in order for graceful fallback.

## Handoffs vs Subagents

| Aspect | Handoffs | Subagents |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Control | User-driven transitions | Agent-initiated |
| Context | Full conversation carries forward | Isolated, only summary returns |
| Visibility | New session with history | Collapsed tool call |
| Best for | Sequential with review gates | Research, analysis, parallel |

## Named Workflow: Plan → Generate → Implement

| Phase | Model | Output | Context |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| PLAN | Premium (reasoning) | plan.md | Clear after |
| GENERATE | Premium (reasoning) | implementation.md | Clear after |
| IMPLEMENT | Free/fast | Incremental commits | Executes verbatim |

Premium models handle reasoning; free models execute. Context clearing between phases prevents rot.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Passing too much context** — Include sufficient but focused context in task prompts
2. **Expecting shared state** — Subagents don't share; main agent must relay
3. **Unbounded depth** — Use `agents: []` and `disable-model-invocation: true` on specialists
4. **Ignoring failures** — Check results, retry once, then continue with available info
5. **Subagents for trivial tasks** — Spawning overhead exists; use tools directly for simple lookups
6. **Unrestricted `agents` array** — Always specify for production orchestrators
