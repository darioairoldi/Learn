# Style Guide — Quantitative Targets and Reference Tables

**Purpose**: Quantitative writing metrics, enforcement targets, and quick-reference lookup tables that complement the auto-loaded `article-writing.instructions.md`.

**Referenced by**:
- `.github/prompts/01.00-article-writing/*.prompt.md` (all article writing prompts)
- `.github/instructions/article-writing.instructions.md` (references this file)

## ⚠️ Instruction Layering

This context file COMPLEMENTS (does not duplicate) auto-loaded instructions:

- `article-writing.instructions.md` — Voice, structure, formatting, Diátaxis, accessibility rules
- `documentation.instructions.md` — Base structure, reference classification, dual metadata

**This file provides:** quantitative targets, formula references, replacement tables, visual documentation guidance, and global-readiness rules sourced from the `03.00-tech/40.00-technical-writing/` article series.

## 📊 Readability Metrics and Targets

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Target Range | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Flesch Reading Ease | 50–70 | Primary readability indicator |
| Flesch-Kincaid Grade | 8–10 (general), 11–12 (advanced) | Grade-level targeting |
| Active Voice % | 80–90% | Voice consistency enforcement |
| Avg Sentence Length | 15–25 words | Sentence complexity check |
| Paragraph Length | 3–5 sentences | Visual density check |

### Secondary Metrics (Deeper Analysis)

| Metric | Target Range | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Gunning Fog Index | 10–14 | Business/technical audience |
| Coleman-Liau Index | 9–11 | Automated CI/CD (character-based, no syllable counting) |
| SMOG Index | 10–13 | Accuracy for healthcare/academic content |
| Dale-Chall Score | 7.0–8.0 | Vocabulary difficulty detection |
| ARI (Automated Readability) | 9–11 | Fast automated pipeline checks |

**CI/CD recommendation:** Use Coleman-Liau or ARI — they're character-based (no syllable counting needed), making them fast and deterministic for automated pipelines.

### Sentence Type Distribution

| Type | Target % | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Simple | 40–50% | Single independent clause |
| Compound | 20–30% | Two independent clauses joined |
| Complex | 20–30% | Independent + dependent clause |
| Compound-complex | <10% | Minimize for readability |

## 🎯 Audience Calibration

The same concept reads differently depending on audience level. Use these examples to calibrate your writing for the target reader.

**Concept: "Progressive disclosure"**

| Audience | Example passage | Characteristics |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Beginner** | "Don't overwhelm readers with everything at once. Start with the basics they need right now, then add more detail as they're ready. Think of it like teaching someone to drive—you don't explain engine mechanics on day one." | Analogy-driven, no jargon, short sentences, conversational |
| **Intermediate** | "Progressive disclosure layers content from essential to advanced. Lead with the surface level (what most users need), provide detail on demand (configuration options, parameters), and reserve expert content (edge cases, internals) for those who seek it." | Term defined on first use, 3-layer model named, concrete categories |
| **Advanced** | "Apply the 3-layer progressive disclosure model: surface (TL;DR, quick-start commands), detail (parameters, configuration, variations), and expert (implementation internals, performance tuning). Map each layer to your Diátaxis type—tutorials expose surface → detail; references expose all three simultaneously." | Assumes prior knowledge, cross-references frameworks, prescriptive |

**Calibration rules by audience:**

| Audience | Jargon handling | Analogies | Flesch target |
|----------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Beginner** | Every technical term marked with `<mark>` and explained in context | Encouraged—bridge to familiar concepts | 60–70 |
| **Intermediate** | Common terms used freely; new terms marked and explained | Sparingly—only for genuinely complex ideas | 50–65 |
| **Advanced** | Domain expertise assumed; only novel jargon marked on first use | Rarely—readers prefer precision over analogy | 45–60 |

📖 **Jargon introduction rules (mark → explain → teach):** `.copilot/context/01.00-article-writing/03-article-creation-rules.md` → Jargon and New Terms

## 📝 Quick-Reference Replacement Tables

### Wordy → Crisp Replacements

## 🌐 Global-Readiness Checklist

Before publishing content for international audiences:

- [ ] Include articles (a, an, the) — don't drop for brevity
- [ ] Include relative pronouns (that, which, who) — don't omit
- [ ] Use SVO sentence order (Subject-Verb-Object)
- [ ] Replace phrasal verbs with single-word equivalents (see table above)
- [ ] Avoid idioms — use plain alternatives
- [ ] Spell out month names in dates (January 5, 2026 — never 1/5/2026)
- [ ] Specify currency codes (USD, not just $)
- [ ] Include time zones for scheduled events
- [ ] Clarify ambiguous words: "once" (one time? after?), "since" (because? from that time?), "while" (during? although?)
- [ ] Use diverse example names (not only Western names/addresses)

## 🎨 Visual Documentation Guidance

### Visual Budget by Diátaxis Type

| Content Type | Visual Budget | Visual Preferred When... |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Tutorial | 3–6 diagrams | Showing step progression |
| How-to | 1–3 diagrams | Illustrating workflows |
| Reference | 0–2 diagrams | Showing API relationships |
| Explanation | 2–5 diagrams | Comparing concepts, architecture |

### Diagramming Standards

- **Default tool**: Mermaid (native rendering in GitHub and Quarto)
- **Architecture**: Use C4 model levels (Context → Container → Component → Code)
- **Pairing**: Always lead text → show visual → explain visual → detail in text
- **Colors**: Maximum 3–5 colors per diagram; never rely on color alone
- **Alt text**: Short description for simple diagrams; detailed description below for complex ones
- **Screenshot naming**: `feature-name-step-N-vX.Y.png` (tracks product version changes)

## 📋 Procedure Writing Rules

📖 **Canonical rules (7-rule list):** `.github/instructions/article-writing.instructions.md` → Procedures (Step-by-Step Instructions)

This section is intentionally a pointer — the detailed procedure rules live in the auto-loaded Tier 1 instructions to avoid duplication.
