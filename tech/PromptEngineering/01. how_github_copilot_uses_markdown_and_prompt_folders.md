# How GitHub Copilot Uses Markdown and Prompt Folders within Your Repo
*(For Visual Studio Code & Visual Studio)*

GitHub Copilot's generative AI is most effective when it has access to a <mark>**structured context**</mark> about your project.  
Both Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and the latest versions of Visual Studio allow you to embed that context directly in your repository using <mark>**markdown-based prompt and instruction files**</mark>.  
These files guide Copilot by encoding reusable prompts, coding standards, business rules, and project documentation.  

This article explains how Copilot consumes these files in **VS Code** and **Visual Studio**, with clarifications based on updated official documentation and community practices.

# 📝 Prompt Files: What They Are and Where They Work

A <mark>**prompt file**</mark> is a <mark>reusable Markdown document</mark> (with a <mark>`.prompt.md` extension</mark>) that you can run as a <mark>slash- or hashtag-command</mark> in Copilot Chat.  
It typically begins with an optional <mark>**YAML header**</mark> specifying metadata such as name, description, agent mode, preferred model and available tools.  
The remainder is the prompt body, written in Markdown, containing the instructions or template you want Copilot to follow.  
For example, a security audit prompt might instruct Copilot to review an API and output a list of vulnerabilities.

Prompt files were first introduced in <mark>VS Code</mark> and <mark>JetBrains IDEs</mark>.  
<mark>**As of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10 and later (including Visual Studio 2026), Visual Studio also supports prompt files**</mark> stored under `.github/prompts` with a `.prompt.md` extension.  
<mark>In Visual Studio, you can reference these prompts by typing `#prompt:<prompt-name>` (or using the "+" icon) to attach the prompt to the chat</mark>.  
For earlier Visual Studio versions (pre-17.10), prompt files are not recognized.

### Required Locations

- <mark>**`.github/prompts/`**</mark> (workspace prompts). This is the default folder for <mark>**workspace-level prompt files**</mark> and is recognized automatically by both VS Code and Visual Studio (17.10+). Any `.prompt.md` file here becomes available in Copilot Chat: <mark>in VS Code it appears as `/promptName`, and in Visual Studio it appears as `#promptName` or `#prompt:<prompt-name>`</mark>.
- **User prompt files** (VS Code only). <mark>User-scope prompts</mark> are stored in a folder within your VS Code profile:
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\prompts\` (stable) or `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders\User\prompts\` (Insiders)
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/prompts/`
  - **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/prompts/`
  
  These prompts are available across all your VS Code workspaces and appear as slash commands (e.g., `/my-prompt`). They do <mark>**not synchronise to your team via Git**</mark>, but you can enable <mark>**VS Code's Settings Sync**</mark> to share them across your own machines. Visual Studio currently has no equivalent mechanism; it only consumes repository-level prompt files.

### Prompt File Variables

Prompt files support <mark>**variable substitution**</mark> to make them dynamic and context-aware:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `${selection}` | Currently selected text in the editor |
| `${selectedText}` | Alias for `${selection}` |
| `${file}` | Full path of the current file |
| `${fileBasename}` | Filename without path |
| `${fileDirname}` | Directory containing the current file |
| `${workspaceFolder}` | Root folder of the workspace |
| `${workspaceFolderBasename}` | Name of the workspace folder |
| `${input:variableName}` | Prompts user for input |
| `${input:variableName:placeholder}` | User input with placeholder text |

Example usage in a prompt file:
```markdown
Analyze the following code from ${fileBasename}:
${selection}

Focus on: ${input:focus:What aspect should I focus on?}
```

### Tool References in Prompts

Prompt files and instructions can reference specific tools using the <mark>**`#tool:<tool-name>`**</mark> syntax:

```markdown
Use #tool:githubRepo to search for similar implementations.
Check #tool:terminalLastCommand for recent command output.
```

Common tool references:
- `#tool:githubRepo` – Search GitHub repositories
- `#tool:terminalLastCommand` – Access recent terminal output
- `#tool:problems` – Get current workspace errors/warnings
- `#tool:codebase` – Search the codebase semantically

### Location **not** automatically supported

Some community blogs suggest grouping Copilot files under a `.github/copilot/prompts/` folder. <mark>**Officially, this location is not recognised by default**</mark>. Both VS Code and Visual Studio expect prompt files in `.github/prompts/` unless you change VS Code's `chat.promptFilesLocations` setting to include the custom path. Visual Studio does not provide a configurable prompt-file location, so it cannot automatically read from `.github/copilot/prompts/`. 

<mark>**Important**: Files stored in `.github/copilot/prompts/` will not automatically show up in Copilot Chat</mark> unless you explicitly configure VS Code settings or manually attach them. The official, out-of-the-box location is `.github/prompts/`.

# 📚 Custom Instructions: Cross-IDE Context

To ensure Copilot respects <mark>**project-specific rules and guidelines**</mark>—such as your naming conventions, security requirements or testing standards—you can add <mark>**custom instructions**</mark>. These instructions are stored in Markdown files that <mark>Copilot automatically injects into every chat request</mark>.

- <mark>**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**</mark> is the <mark>**repository-wide**</mark> instructions file. Both VS Code and Visual Studio support this file, provided that the "Use Instruction Files" feature is enabled. The file should contain concise, self-contained statements about your project's coding guidelines or tooling requirements. In Visual Studio, you must enable custom instructions in the Copilot settings (Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Chat). Once enabled, instructions are injected into every chat request but remain hidden from view.

- <mark>**`.github/instructions/`**</mark> holds one or more `.instructions.md` files for <mark>**path- or language-specific guidance**</mark>. Each file can specify front-matter fields like `applyTo` to control which files or folders the instructions apply to (e.g., only `**/*.cs` for C# files). This feature is supported by both VS Code and Visual Studio 17.10+ (though Visual Studio requires the custom instructions feature to be enabled). Visual Studio 2022 versions prior to 17.10 do not support custom instructions.

### Instructions File Frontmatter

```yaml
---
applyTo: "**/*.ts"           # Glob pattern for matching files
excludeAgent: "code-review"   # Exclude from specific agents
---
```

The <mark>**`excludeAgent`**</mark> property controls which agents should NOT use these instructions:
- `"code-review"` – Excludes instructions from Copilot code review
- `"coding-agent"` – Excludes instructions from the GitHub Copilot coding agent

# 🤖 Chat Modes in VS Code

GitHub Copilot Chat provides <mark>**four built-in chat modes**</mark> accessible via the agent picker in the chat input:

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| <mark>**Agent**</mark> | Autonomous mode that determines necessary changes and applies them directly to your workspace | Complex multi-file refactoring, feature implementation |
| <mark>**Plan**</mark> | Creates detailed implementation plans without modifying files (read-only) | Architecture planning, understanding approach before execution |
| <mark>**Ask**</mark> | Q&A mode for questions without file modifications | Learning, code explanations, debugging assistance |
| <mark>**Edit**</mark> | Direct code editing mode for targeted changes | Quick fixes, single-file modifications |

These built-in modes <mark>**supersede many custom multi-phase agent patterns**</mark> that were previously required. For example, a three-phase "analyze → plan → implement" workflow can now be achieved by using Plan mode first, then switching to Agent mode for execution.

# 🔧 Custom Agents

<mark>**Custom agents**</mark> (previously called "chat modes") allow you to define specialized AI personas with specific tools, instructions, and workflows. These are stored as <mark>**`.agent.md`**</mark> files and are available from <mark>**VS Code 1.106+**</mark>.

For comprehensive guidance on structuring agent files, defining personas, configuring tools, and creating handoff workflows, see [How to Structure Content for Copilot Agent Files](./04.%20how_to_structure_content_for_copilot_agent_files.md).

### Agent File Locations

- <mark>**`.github/agents/`**</mark> – Workspace-level agents shared via Git with your team
- **User profile folder** (VS Code only) – Personal agents available across all workspaces

### Agent File Structure

Each `.agent.md` file includes:
- **YAML frontmatter** specifying tools, model preferences, and target environment
- **Markdown body** containing the agent's persona, instructions, and workflow
- **Handoffs** (optional) for orchestrating multi-step workflows between agents

```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
tools:
  - read_file
  - semantic_search
  - grep_search
model: claude-sonnet-4
target: vscode
---
You are a security expert. Analyze the provided code for:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS attack vectors
- Authentication bypasses
...
```

**Supported frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Agent identifier |
| `description` | Brief description shown in agent picker |
| `argument-hint` | Placeholder text in chat input |
| `tools` | List of tools/tool sets the agent can use |
| `model` | Preferred AI model (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4`, `gpt-4o`) |
| `target` | Environment: `vscode` or `github-copilot` |
| `mcp-servers` | MCP server configs (for `github-copilot` target) |
| `handoffs` | Workflow transitions to other agents |

### Handoffs: Multi-Agent Workflows

<mark>**Handoffs**</mark> enable orchestrating multi-step workflows between agents:

```yaml
---
name: architect
description: Plans implementation approach
handoffs:
  - label: Start Implementation
    agent: implementer
    prompt: Now implement the plan outlined above.
    send: false  # false = user reviews before sending
---
```

When the architect agent completes its task, the user sees a "Start Implementation" button to hand off to the implementer agent.

### AGENTS.md vs .agent.md

<mark>**Important distinction:**</mark>

| File | Used By | Execution | Location |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **`AGENTS.md`** | GitHub Copilot coding agent | Asynchronous (runs on GitHub, creates PRs) | Repo root (or subfolders*) |
| **`CLAUDE.md`** | Alternative to AGENTS.md | Same as AGENTS.md | Repo root |
| **`GEMINI.md`** | Alternative to AGENTS.md | Same as AGENTS.md | Repo root |
| **`.agent.md`** | VS Code chat agents | Interactive (runs locally in IDE) | `.github/agents/` |

*<small>Nested `AGENTS.md` files in subfolders are supported experimentally via the `chat.useNestedAgentsMdFiles` setting. The nearest file in the directory tree takes precedence.</small>

Visual Studio uses `AGENTS.md` (or alternatives) for its coding agent integration but does not currently support `.agent.md` files for chat.

# 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The <mark>**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**</mark> is now generally available in VS Code (1.102+). MCP provides a <mark>**standardized way to connect Copilot to external data sources and tools**</mark>.

### What MCP Enables

- **Structured tool access** – Connect to databases, APIs, cloud services
- **Typed data retrieval** – Get data in formats Copilot can reason about
- **Reduced tool clash** – Narrowly-scoped tool definitions prevent conflicts

### Configuration

MCP servers are configured via `mcp.json` files in your workspace or user settings. The GitHub MCP registry at [github.com/mcp](https://github.com/mcp) provides pre-built servers for common integrations.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-devops": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@azure/mcp-server-ado"]
    }
  }
}
```

MCP is particularly valuable for building specialized agents that need access to external systems—such as an Azure DevOps agent that can query work items, or a database agent that can inspect schemas.

# 📁 Optional `.copilot/` Folder: Enhancing Local Context

Although not part of the official specification, a practical <mark>**`.copilot/`**</mark> directory can hold rich project documentation and reference materials to help Copilot understand your codebase. It may include subfolders such as:

- <mark>`context/`</mark> (e.g. data schemas, API contracts, code patterns, workflows, guidelines, examples) – <mark>Copilot will index files here and use them to inform its responses</mark>.
- `architecture/`, `troubleshooting/`, `examples/`, `images/`, `data/`, `reference/` – these are suggested subfolders used in some community guides. <mark>None of these files automatically generate chat commands; they simply improve the semantic search</mark> used by Copilot in both VS Code and Visual Studio.

# ⚙️ VS Code Settings Reference

# 🔑 Key Takeaways

| Capability | VS Code | Visual Studio 2022 (17.10+) | Earlier VS versions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Workspace prompt files** (`.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`) | Supported; slash commands `/promptName` appear in chat | Supported; use hashtag commands `#promptName` (since 17.10) | Not supported prior to 17.10 |
| **User prompt files** (`\.prompt.md` in VS Code profile) | Available as personal slash commands across all projects | Not supported | Not applicable |
| **Repo-level instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) | Supported (requires enabling the “Use Instruction Files” setting) | Supported (requires enabling custom instructions in options) | Not supported prior to 17.10 |
| **Path-specific instructions** (`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`) | Supported with `applyTo` patterns | Supported (requires enabling custom instructions) | Not supported prior to 17.10 |
| **Custom agents** (`.github/agents/*.agent.md`) | Supported from VS Code 1.106+. Each `.agent.md` defines a specialized persona, tools, and workflow. Supports handoffs for multi-agent orchestration. | Not supported for chat; Visual Studio uses `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `GEMINI.md` for its async coding agent (creates PRs). | Not available |
| **Chat modes** (Agent, Plan, Ask, Edit) | Built-in modes available via agent picker. Agent mode enables autonomous file editing; Plan mode creates implementation plans. | Not applicable; Visual Studio has different interaction patterns. | Not available |
| **MCP servers** (`mcp.json`) | Generally available (VS Code 1.102+). Connect to external data sources and tools via Model Context Protocol. | Not currently supported. | Not available |
| **`.github/copilot/` directory** | Optional; backed by community best practices for storing shared context, knowledge, patterns and examples. These files improve context but don't create commands. | Optional; improves local semantic search in Visual Studio. | Optional (if user chooses), but not part of official features. |

By following these updated guidelines—placing prompt files in `.github/prompts/` with a `.prompt.md` suffix, activating instruction files appropriately, and using a `.copilot/` folder for extended context—you can leverage GitHub Copilot effectively across both **VS Code** and the latest **Visual Studio** versions.

# 📎 Appendix A: Legacy .chatmode.md Migration

Prior to VS Code 1.106, custom agents were called "chat modes" and used different file conventions:

| Legacy | Current |
|--------|--------|
| `.chatmode.md` extension | `.agent.md` extension |
| `.github/chatmodes/` folder | `.github/agents/` folder |

### Migration Steps

1. VS Code automatically recognizes legacy `.chatmode.md` files
2. A **Quick Fix** action appears to migrate files to the new format
3. Rename files from `*.chatmode.md` to `*.agent.md`
4. Move files from `.github/chatmodes/` to `.github/agents/`

<mark>**Recommendation:**</mark> Migrate to the new format for consistency with current documentation and to ensure future compatibility.

---

# 📎 Appendix B: JetBrains IDE Support

JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.) support GitHub Copilot with their own conventions:

## Supported Files

| File Type | Location | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Workspace instructions** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Same as VS Code/Visual Studio |
| **Global instructions** | OS-specific path (see below) | Personal instructions across all projects |
| **Prompt files** | `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` | Invoked via `/promptName` commands |

## Global Instructions Location

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\JetBrains\<product><version>\copilot\global-copilot-instructions.md` |
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/<product><version>/copilot/global-copilot-instructions.md` |
| **Linux** | `~/.config/JetBrains/<product><version>/copilot/global-copilot-instructions.md` |

*Replace `<product><version>` with your IDE (e.g., `IntelliJIdea2024.3`, `PyCharm2024.3`).*

## Differences from VS Code

- JetBrains does **not** support `.agent.md` files (custom agents)
- JetBrains does **not** support MCP server configuration
- Path-specific `.instructions.md` files work the same as VS Code
- Prompt files use `/promptName` syntax (same as VS Code)

---

# 📎 Appendix C: Deprecated VS Code Settings

The following settings are <mark>**deprecated as of VS Code 1.102**</mark>. Use `.instructions.md` files instead:

| Deprecated Setting | Migration |
|-------------------|----------|
| `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions` | Use `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` with `applyTo` patterns |
| `github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions` | Use `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` with `applyTo` patterns |

<mark>**Recommendation:**</mark> Remove these deprecated settings from your VS Code configuration and migrate to instruction files for better maintainability and version control.
