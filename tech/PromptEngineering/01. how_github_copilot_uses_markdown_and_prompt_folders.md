# How GitHub Copilot Uses Markdown and Prompt Folders within Your Repo
*(For Visual Studio Code & Visual Studio)*

GitHub Copilot's generative AI is most effective when it has access to a <mark>**structured context**</mark> about your project.  
Both Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and the latest versions of Visual Studio allow you to embed that context directly in your repository using <mark>**markdown-based prompt and instruction files**</mark>.  
These files guide Copilot by encoding reusable prompts, coding standards, business rules, and project documentation.  

This article explains how Copilot consumes these files in **VS Code** and **Visual Studio**, with clarifications based on updated official documentation and community practices.

# 📝 Prompt Files: What They Are and Where They Work

A <mark>**prompt file**</mark> is a <mark>reusable Markdown document</mark> (with a <mark>`.prompt.md` extension</mark>) that you can run as a <mark>slash- or hashtag-command</mark> in Copilot Chat.  
It typically begins with an optional <mark>**YAML header**</mark> specifying metadata such as name, description, agent mode, preferred model and available tools.  
The remainder is the prompt body, written in Markdown, containing the instructions or template you want Copilot to follow.  
For example, a security audit prompt might instruct Copilot to review an API and output a list of vulnerabilities.

Prompt files were first introduced in <mark>VS Code</mark> and <mark>JetBrains IDEs</mark>.  
<mark>**As of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10 and later (including Visual Studio 2026), Visual Studio also supports prompt files**</mark> stored under `.github/prompts` with a `.prompt.md` extension.  
<mark>In Visual Studio, you can reference these prompts by typing `#prompt:<prompt-name>` (or using the "+" icon) to attach the prompt to the chat</mark>.  
For earlier Visual Studio versions (pre-17.10), prompt files are not recognized.

### Required Locations

- <mark>**`.github/prompts/`**</mark> (workspace prompts). This is the default folder for <mark>**workspace-level prompt files**</mark> and is recognized automatically by both VS Code and Visual Studio (17.10+). Any `.prompt.md` file here becomes available in Copilot Chat: <mark>in VS Code it appears as `/promptName`, and in Visual Studio it appears as `#promptName` or `#prompt:<prompt-name>`</mark>.
- **User prompt files** (VS Code only). <mark>User-scope prompts</mark> are stored in a folder within your VS Code profile:
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\prompts\` (stable) or `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders\User\prompts\` (Insiders)
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/prompts/`
  - **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/prompts/`
  
  These prompts are available across all your VS Code workspaces and appear as slash commands (e.g., `/my-prompt`). They do <mark>**not synchronise to your team via Git**</mark>, but you can enable <mark>**VS Code's Settings Sync**</mark> to share them across your own machines. Visual Studio currently has no equivalent mechanism; it only consumes repository-level prompt files.

### Location **not** automatically supported

Some community blogs suggest grouping Copilot files under a `.github/copilot/prompts/` folder. <mark>**Officially, this location is not recognised by default**</mark>. Both VS Code and Visual Studio expect prompt files in `.github/prompts/` unless you change VS Code's `chat.promptFilesLocations` setting to include the custom path. Visual Studio does not provide a configurable prompt-file location, so it cannot automatically read from `.github/copilot/prompts/`. 

<mark>**Important**: Files stored in `.github/copilot/prompts/` will not automatically show up in Copilot Chat</mark> unless you explicitly configure VS Code settings or manually attach them. The official, out-of-the-box location is `.github/prompts/`.

# 📚 Custom Instructions: Cross-IDE Context

To ensure Copilot respects <mark>**project-specific rules and guidelines**</mark>—such as your naming conventions, security requirements or testing standards—you can add <mark>**custom instructions**</mark>. These instructions are stored in Markdown files that <mark>Copilot automatically injects into every chat request</mark>.

- <mark>**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**</mark> is the <mark>**repository-wide**</mark> instructions file. Both VS Code and Visual Studio support this file, provided that the "Use Instruction Files" feature is enabled. The file should contain concise, self-contained statements about your project's coding guidelines or tooling requirements. In Visual Studio, you must enable custom instructions in the Copilot settings (Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Chat). Once enabled, instructions are injected into every chat request but remain hidden from view.

- <mark>**`.github/instructions/`**</mark> holds one or more `.instructions.md` files for <mark>**path- or language-specific guidance**</mark>. Each file can specify front-matter fields like `applyTo` to control which files or folders the instructions apply to (e.g., only `**/*.cs` for C# files). This feature is supported by both VS Code and Visual Studio 17.10+ (though Visual Studio requires the custom instructions feature to be enabled). Visual Studio 2022 versions prior to 17.10 do not support custom instructions.

# 📁 Optional `.copilot/` Folder: Enhancing Local Context

Although not part of the official specification, a practical <mark>**`.copilot/`**</mark> directory can hold rich project documentation and reference materials to help Copilot understand your codebase. It may include subfolders such as:

- <mark>`context/`</mark> (e.g. data schemas, API contracts, code patterns, workflows, guidelines, examples) – <mark>Copilot will index files here and use them to inform its responses</mark>.
- `architecture/`, `troubleshooting/`, `examples/`, `images/`, `data/`, `reference/` – these are suggested subfolders used in some community guides. <mark>None of these files automatically generate chat commands; they simply improve the semantic search</mark> used by Copilot in both VS Code and Visual Studio.

# 🔑 Key Takeaways

| Capability | VS Code | Visual Studio 2022 (17.10+) | Earlier VS versions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Workspace prompt files** (`.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`) | Supported; slash commands `/promptName` appear in chat | Supported; use hashtag commands `#promptName` (since 17.10) | Not supported prior to 17.10 |
| **User prompt files** (`\.prompt.md` in VS Code profile) | Available as personal slash commands across all projects | Not supported | Not applicable |
| **Repo-level instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) | Supported (requires enabling the “Use Instruction Files” setting) | Supported (requires enabling custom instructions in options) | Not supported prior to 17.10 |
| **Path-specific instructions** (`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`) | Supported with `applyTo` patterns | Supported (requires enabling custom instructions) | Not supported prior to 17.10 |
| **Custom agents** (`.github/agents/*.agent.md`) | Supported from VS Code 1.106 (Preview). Each `.agent.md` defines a specialized persona and workflow in VS Code. Not supported by the Visual Studio chat; Visual Studio uses a separate `AGENTS.md` mechanism. | Not recognized by Visual Studio for chat; instead, Visual Studio uses its own `AGENTS.md` file for guiding its coding agents. | Not available |
| **`.github/copilot/` directory** | Optional; backed by community best practices for storing shared context, knowledge, patterns and examples. These files improve context but don't create commands. | Optional; improves local semantic search in Visual Studio. | Optional (if user chooses), but not part of official features. |

By following these updated guidelines—placing prompt files in `.github/prompts/` with a `.prompt.md` suffix, activating instruction files appropriately, and using a `.copilot/` folder for extended context—you can leverage GitHub Copilot effectively across both **VS Code** and the latest **Visual Studio** versions.
