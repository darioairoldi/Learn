# How to Name and Organize Prompt Files in Your GitHub Repository

A well-organized repository helps <mark>**both developers and AI assistants**</mark> like GitHub Copilot quickly locate the resources they need. Prompt files and their supporting documents benefit from <mark>predictable structures and conventions</mark>. This article synthesizes the latest GitHub Copilot, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Visual Studio documentation, along with community best practices, to provide clear guidance on naming and organizing Copilot-related files.

# 📁 Use the `.github` folder for team-shared prompts and instructions

GitHub Copilot looks in specific subfolders of `.github/` to find <mark>prompt files, instructions and (in VS Code) custom agent definitions</mark>.

| Path                                | Purpose | Notes |
|------------------------------------|---------|-------|
|------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| <mark>**`.github/prompts/`**</mark>             | <mark>**Workspace prompt files.**</mark> Each `*.prompt.md` file here becomes a slash-command (`/promptName` in VS Code) or a hashtag command (`#promptName` in Visual Studio) when using Copilot Chat. This folder is recognized by VS Code and **Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.10+)**. Older versions of Visual Studio (before 17.10) do not support prompt files. <mark>Note that prompt files must use the `.prompt.md` extension</mark>; there is no official support for a plain `.prompt` extension. Each file can start with YAML front matter specifying metadata (`name`, `description`, `agent`, `model`, `tools`, etc.) followed by the Markdown content of the prompt. |
| <mark>**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**</mark> | <mark>**Repository-level custom instructions.**</mark> This file provides guidance on how Copilot should behave for your project (coding standards, tool preferences, naming conventions, etc.). <mark>It's automatically applied to all chat requests when the "custom instructions" feature is enabled</mark>, and is supported by both VS Code and Visual Studio 17.10+. |
| <mark>**`.github/instructions/`**</mark>         | <mark>**Path- or language-specific instructions.**</mark> Store one or more `.instructions.md` files here. Each file uses YAML front matter fields like `applyTo` to specify globs (e.g., `**/*.cs`, `docs/**/*.md`) that determine when the instructions should be applied. Supported in both VS Code and Visual Studio 17.10+. |
| <mark>**`.github/agents/`**</mark>               | <mark>**Custom agents for VS Code / Copilot CLI**</mark> (preview). In VS Code 1.106 (Preview) and Copilot CLI, `.agent.md` files here define specialized personas (e.g., "planning agent," "test specialist"). Each file contains YAML to declare allowed tools, a description, optional handoffs, and a Markdown body describing the agent's behavior. <mark>These are not used by Visual Studio Chat, which instead employs a separate `AGENTS.md` mechanism</mark>. |
| **`.github/copilot/`**               | **Community convention for shared context.** Some teams create a `.github/copilot/` folder to gather prompts and domain knowledge (e.g. `knowledge/`, `examples/`) in one place. <mark>Only a subfolder named `prompts/` under `.github` is recognized by default</mark>; other subfolders under `.github/copilot` serve as shared documentation and must be referenced manually in prompts or instructions. |
| <mark>**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**</mark> | <mark>**Repository-level custom instructions.**</mark> This file provides guidance on how Copilot should behave for your project (coding standards, tool preferences, naming conventions, etc.). <mark>It's automatically applied to all chat requests when the "custom instructions" feature is enabled</mark>, and is supported by both VS Code and Visual Studio 17.10+. |
| **`.github/instructions/`**         | **Path- or language-specific instructions.** Store one or more `.instructions.md` files here. Each file uses YAML front matter fields like `applyTo` to specify globs (e.g., `**/*.cs`, `docs/**/*.md`) that determine when the instructions should be applied. Supported in both VS Code and Visual Studio 17.10+. |
| **`.github/agents/`**               | **Custom agents for VS Code / Copilot CLI** (preview). In VS Code 1.106 (Preview) and Copilot CLI, `.agent.md` files here define specialized personas (e.g., “planning agent,” “test specialist”). Each file contains YAML to declare allowed tools, a description, optional handoffs, and a Markdown body describing the agent’s behavior. These are not used by Visual Studio Chat, which instead employs a separate `AGENTS.md` mechanism. |
| **`.github/copilot/`**               | **Community convention for shared context.** Some teams create a `.github/copilot/` folder to gather prompts and domain knowledge (e.g. `knowledge/`, `examples/`) in one place. Only a subfolder named `prompts/` under `.github` is recognized by default; other subfolders under `.github/copilot` serve as shared documentation and must be referenced manually in prompts or instructions. |

### Naming Guidelines for Prompt Files

1. <mark>**Consistent naming:**</mark> Use lowercase with hyphens or dots (e.g., `create-react-form.prompt.md`) to reflect the task or role. <mark>The filename or the YAML `name` becomes the slash/hashtag command</mark>.
2. <mark>**Single purpose:**</mark> Each prompt file should perform a distinct, cohesive task (e.g., "generate unit tests" or "review API security"). Avoid mixing unrelated tasks in one prompt.
3. **Descriptive metadata:** Include a `description` in the YAML header. VS Code and Visual Studio display this text when listing the prompt in the Chat UI. You can also set fields like `agent` (ask, edit, agent mode), `model`, `tools`, or `argument-hint` to refine prompt execution.

# 💼 Organizing Local Context in `.copilot` (Optional)

If you want Copilot to provide more project-aware suggestions, consider creating a <mark>`.copilot/`</mark> directory at your repository root. While this is **not an official requirement**, it's a community-recommended way to store detailed project documentation, domain concepts, architecture diagrams and other reference materials. <mark>Copilot's semantic search will index the contents of `.copilot/context/`</mark>, making it more likely to find relevant documents when answering questions about your codebase.

A typical `.copilot/context/` folder might include:

- `dataschemas/` – JSON or database schema docs. 
- `apis/` – internal and external API contracts. 
- `patterns/` – coding conventions (e.g., error handling, logging, testing guidelines). 
- `workflows/` – business processes and flows. 
- `guidelines/` – coding standards, architecture principles, security patterns. 
- `images/` and `examples/` – diagrams, charts and reference code.

<mark>These files do **not** create slash commands; instead, they enrich the context Copilot can draw upon</mark>.

# 💡 Additional Tips

- <mark>**Centralize general rules**</mark> in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and use more granular `.instructions.md` files for narrower scopes (e.g. language-specific or directory-specific rules). Note that custom instructions must be enabled to be applied in Visual Studio or VS Code.
- **Link to project docs** within your prompts or instructions using Markdown links, or use `#fetch` and `#file` references in VS Code to import remote or local content into Chat. (These tool references currently work in VS Code Chat; Visual Studio may not support every tool yet.)
- <mark>**Iterative improvement**</mark>: Test prompts and update them based on feedback. Copilot's responses are non-deterministic; small tweaks often change the quality of output. Encourage team members to contribute and refine prompts.

By following these naming and organization practices—and understanding where each file type is supported—you can ensure that GitHub Copilot operates consistently across your team's tools and versions.
