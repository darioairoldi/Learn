# 📁 Use the `.github` folder for team-shared prompts and instructions

GitHub Copilot looks in specific subfolders of `.github/` to find <mark>prompt files, instructions and (in VS Code) custom agent definitions</mark>.

| Path                                | Purpose | 
|-------------------------------------|---------|
| <mark>**`.github/prompts/`**</mark>             | <mark>**Workspace prompt files.**</mark> Each `*.prompt.md` file here becomes a slash-command (`/promptName` in VS Code) or a hashtag command (`#promptName` or `#prompt:<prompt-name>` in Visual Studio) when using Copilot Chat. This folder is recognized by VS Code and **Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.10+)**. Older versions of Visual Studio (before 17.10) do not support prompt files. <mark>**Note that prompt files must use the `.prompt.md` extension**</mark>; <mark>**there is no official support for a plain `.prompt` extension**</mark>. The `.prompt` extension (without `.md`) is not recognized by Copilot in VS Code or Visual Studio. Each file can start with YAML front matter specifying metadata (`name`, `description`, `agent`, `model`, `tools`, etc.) followed by the Markdown content of the prompt. |
| <mark>**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**</mark> | <mark>**Repository-level custom instructions.**</mark> This file provides guidance on how Copilot should behave for your project (coding standards, tool preferences, naming conventions, etc.). <mark>It's automatically applied to all chat requests when the "custom instructions" feature is enabled</mark>, and is supported by both VS Code and Visual Studio 17.10+. |
| <mark>**`.github/instructions/`**</mark>         | <mark>**Path- or language-specific instructions.**</mark> Store one or more `.instructions.md` files here. Each file uses YAML front matter fields like `applyTo` to specify globs (e.g., `**/*.cs`, `docs/**/*.md`) that determine when the instructions should be applied. Supported in both VS Code and Visual Studio 17.10+. |
| <mark>**`.github/agents/`**</mark>               | <mark>**Custom agents for VS Code / Copilot CLI**</mark>. In VS Code 1.106+ and Copilot CLI, `.agent.md` files here define specialized personas (e.g., "planning agent," "test specialist"). Each file contains YAML frontmatter to declare allowed `tools`, a `description`, optional `handoffs` for workflow transitions, `model` selection, and a Markdown body describing the agent's behavior. Legacy `.chatmode.md` files are still recognized but can be migrated using VS Code's Quick Fix action. <mark>**Note:** This is different from `AGENTS.md` files (see below)</mark>. |
| **`AGENTS.md`** (anywhere in repo)              | <mark>**Agent instructions for Copilot Coding Agent.**</mark> You can create one or more `AGENTS.md` files stored anywhere in the repository. The nearest file in the directory tree takes precedence. Alternatively, you can use `CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md` in the repository root. These files provide instructions for AI agents working on your codebase, supported in VS Code, Visual Studio, and GitHub.com. <mark>**Note:** `AGENTS.md` provides instructions to agents, while `.agent.md` files define custom agent personas</mark>. |
| **`.github/copilot/`**               | **Community convention for shared context.** Some teams create a `.github/copilot/` folder to gather prompts and domain knowledge (e.g. `knowledge/`, `examples/`) in one place. <mark>Only a subfolder named `prompts/` under `.github` is recognized by default</mark>; other subfolders under `.github/copilot` serve as shared documentation and must be referenced manually in prompts or instructions. |

> **Note about `.prompt.yml` files**: GitHub also supports `.prompt.yml` or `.prompt.yaml` files for storing prompts intended for other GitHub AI tools (such as GitHub Models).  
These YAML-based prompt files are **not used by GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code or Visual Studio.  
For Copilot Chat, you must use the `.prompt.md` Markdown format.



### Naming Guidelines for Prompt Files

1. <mark>**Consistent naming:**</mark> Use lowercase with hyphens or dots (e.g., `create-react-form.prompt.md`) to reflect the task or role. <mark>The filename or the YAML `name` becomes the slash/hashtag command</mark>.
2. <mark>**Single purpose:**</mark> Each prompt file should perform a distinct, cohesive task (e.g., "generate unit tests" or "review API security"). Avoid mixing unrelated tasks in one prompt.
3. **Descriptive metadata:** Include a `description` in the YAML header. VS Code and Visual Studio display this text when listing the prompt in the Chat UI. You can also set fields like `agent` (ask, edit, agent mode), `model`, `tools`, or `argument-hint` to refine prompt execution.

# 💼 Organizing Local Context in `.copilot` (Optional)

If you want Copilot to provide more project-aware suggestions, consider creating a <mark>`.copilot/`</mark> directory at your repository root. While this is **not an official requirement**, it's a community-recommended way to store detailed project documentation, domain concepts, architecture diagrams and other reference materials. <mark>Copilot's semantic search will index the contents of `.copilot/context/`</mark>, making it more likely to find relevant documents when answering questions about your codebase.

A typical `.copilot/context/` folder might include:

- `dataschemas/` – JSON or database schema docs. 
- `apis/` – internal and external API contracts. 
- `patterns/` – coding conventions (e.g., error handling, logging, testing guidelines). 
- `workflows/` – business processes and flows. 
- `guidelines/` – coding standards, architecture principles, security patterns. 
- `images/` and `examples/` – diagrams, charts and reference code.

<mark>These files do **not** create slash commands; instead, they enrich the context Copilot can draw upon</mark>.

# 👤 User Prompts in VS Code (Personal Prompt Library)

In addition to workspace prompts, <mark>**VS Code supports user-scope prompt files**</mark> that are available across all your projects. These personal prompts are stored in your VS Code profile directory:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\prompts\` (stable) or `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders\User\prompts\` (Insiders)
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/prompts/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/prompts/`

User prompt files:
- Appear in Copilot Chat as slash commands (e.g., `/my-personal-prompt`) across all workspaces
- Do **not sync to your team via Git** (they're stored locally in your profile)
- Can be shared across your own machines using <mark>**VS Code's Settings Sync**</mark> feature
- Follow the same `.prompt.md` format and YAML frontmatter as workspace prompts

<mark>**Visual Studio does not currently support user-scope prompt files**</mark>; it only recognizes workspace-level prompts in `.github/prompts/`.

# 💡 Additional Tips

- <mark>**Centralize general rules**</mark> in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and use more granular `.instructions.md` files for narrower scopes (e.g. language-specific or directory-specific rules). Note that custom instructions must be enabled to be applied in Visual Studio or VS Code.
- **JetBrains IDE support:** Prompt files are now supported in JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.). You can create prompt files via the settings page under Tools > GitHub Copilot > Customizations, or manually in `.github/prompts/`. Use `/promptName` in chat to invoke them.
- **Link to project docs** within your prompts or instructions using Markdown links, or use `#fetch` and `#file` references in VS Code to import remote or local content into Chat. (These tool references currently work in VS Code Chat; Visual Studio may not support every tool yet.)
- <mark>**Iterative improvement**</mark>: Test prompts and update them based on feedback. Copilot's responses are non-deterministic; small tweaks often change the quality of output. Encourage team members to contribute and refine prompts.

By following these naming and organization practices—and understanding where each file type is supported—you can ensure that GitHub Copilot operates consistently across your team's tools and versions.

# 📎 Appendix A: Legacy .chatmode.md Migration

**Deprecated as of:** VS Code 1.106  
**Replaced by:** `.agent.md` files in `.github/agents/`

Prior to VS Code 1.106, custom agents were called "chat modes" and used different file conventions:

| Legacy | Current |
|--------|---------|
| `.chatmode.md` extension | `.agent.md` extension |
| `.github/chatmodes/` folder | `.github/agents/` folder |
| Limited frontmatter fields | Extended frontmatter with `handoffs`, `target`, `mcp-servers` |

### Migration Steps

1. VS Code automatically recognizes legacy `.chatmode.md` files as custom agents
2. Open any `.chatmode.md` file and use the **Quick Fix** action (lightbulb) to migrate
3. The Quick Fix renames the file to `.agent.md` and moves it to `.github/agents/`
4. Update any team documentation referencing the old paths

### New Frontmatter Fields

Custom agents now support additional configuration options:

```yaml
---
description: Generate an implementation plan
name: Planner
tools: ['fetch', 'githubRepo', 'search']
model: Claude Sonnet 4
target: vscode  # or 'github-copilot' for remote agents
handoffs:
  - label: Start Implementation
    agent: agent
    prompt: Implement the plan outlined above.
    send: false
mcp-servers:  # For github-copilot target only
  - name: my-server
    url: https://...
