## **Q. 01** Are prompt files supported in Visual Studio?  
is the following statement correct? 
> However, **prompt files are only recognized in Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IDEs**; they are not currently supported in Visual Studio.  
Visual Studio 2222 and 2026 seem to provide support for prompt files 

**A. 01** The statement that “prompt files are only recognized in VS Code and JetBrains IDEs; they are not currently supported in Visual Studio” is outdated.

**As of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10 and later—including Visual Studio 2026—prompt files are officially supported in Visual Studio.** Microsoft’s own documentation on customizing Copilot Chat in Visual Studio explains how to create and use prompt files:

*   You can author a prompt in a `.prompt.md` file and save it under `.github/prompts/` in your repository. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/copilot-chat-context?view=visualstudio)
*   In Visual Studio, Copilot Chat lets you reference these prompts by typing `#prompt:<prompt-name>` (or by using the “+” icon) to attach the prompt to the chat. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/copilot-chat-context?view=visualstudio)
*   Visual Studio’s Copilot Chat translates these prompts into the request it sends to the model, similar to how VS Code uses `/promptName` in its chat.

Moreover, both the Visual Studio product blog and external news sources highlight that reusable prompt files are now “available in Visual Studio”. Therefore, the earlier guidance that prompt files are exclusive to VS Code and JetBrains no longer applies; developers using Visual Studio (v17.10+ and beyond) can leverage `.prompt.md` files just as those on other editors do. [\[devblogs.m...rosoft.com\]](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/boost-your-copilot-collaboration-with-reusable-prompt-files/), [\[magnetism.ai\]](https://www.magnetism.ai/news/reusable-prompt-files-now-available-in-visual-studio-with-github-copilot)

## **Q. 02** is prompt file extension .prompt.md or .prompt?

why the article states 
 prompt file is a reusable Markdown template (with a .prompt.md extension) that you can run like a slash-command in Copilot Chat.

aren't normally named with .prompt extension?

I remember that files under
.github\copilot\prompts
used by VS Code normally have 
.prompt extension 

is it possible to use them also with prompt.md extension?

Please verify Github, githup copilot and vscode documentation and understand which extensions are really supported

**A. 02** 
I’ve double-checked the latest documentation from GitHub, the VS Code docs, and the recent Visual Studio/Visual Studio 2026 blogs. Officially, Copilot prompt files are **Markdown files with the `.prompt.md` extension**. This is backed up by:

*   The official VS Code prompt file guide, which states: “Prompt files are Markdown files and use the **`.prompt.md` extension**.” [\[code.visua...studio.com\]](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files)
*   The GitHub Docs example for “Your first prompt file” instructs users to save the file as `explain-code.prompt.md` under `.github/prompts/`. [\[docs.github.com\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/customization-library/prompt-files/your-first-prompt-file)
*   Visual Studio guidance for version 17.10+ (and Visual Studio 2026) says to “place \[the prompt] in the `.github/prompts` folder with the filename format `[promptName].prompt.md`” and reference it via slash/hashtag commands.
*   The .NET Blog on prompt files and custom instructions reiterates: “Place your prompt in the `.github/prompts` folder with the filename `[promptname].prompt.md`”.

I could not find any official Copilot documentation or tooling that supports using just a `.prompt` extension. It’s possible you encountered an older community example or a different (e.g., YAML-based) prompt format—GitHub now also supports `.prompt.yml` or `.prompt.yaml` for storing prompts intended for other GitHub AI tools, which might be causing some confusion. For Copilot prompt files used in VS Code or Visual Studio Chat, the supported extension is `.prompt.md`. [\[docs.github.com\]](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/use-github-models/storing-prompts-in-github-repositories)

## **Q. 03** which are prompt files folders really used by github copilot in vscode and visual studio (.github/copilot/prompts )
I thought the real folder for prompt files is 
.github/copilot/prompts 
please check github copilot, vscode and visual studio documentation 
and understand if the statements are correct 

**A. 03** 

I checked the official sources from GitHub, Visual Studio Code and the recent Visual Studio documentation. Here’s what’s confirmed:

*   **Default folder:** For both VS Code and Visual Studio (2022 and later), **prompt files must reside in `.github/prompts/` by default** to be automatically recognized by Copilot Chat. Visual Studio’s documentation on customizing chat confirms the same: it instructs you to place your prompt files in `.github/prompts` with a `.prompt.md` extension and reference them via a slash (VS Code) or hashtag (Visual Studio) command. [\[code.visua...studio.com\]](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files)

*   **Extension:** The official extension for prompt files is **`.prompt.md`**. The VS Code docs explicitly state that “prompt files are Markdown files and use the `.prompt.md` extension”. This ensures they are detected and surfaced in the UI. There’s no evidence in documentation that a plain `.prompt` (without `.md`) extension is supported by default. [\[code.visua...studio.com\]](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files)

*   **`.github/copilot/prompts`:** This path is *not* part of the official Copilot or VS Code documentation. Some community guides suggest placing prompts in `.github/copilot/prompts` to group all Copilot-related files, but for VS Code and Visual Studio to detect prompt files automatically, they must be inside `.github/prompts` (unless you’ve customized your settings). In Visual Studio, there’s also no mention of `.github/copilot/prompts` in Microsoft’s docs. [\[code.visua...studio.com\]](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files)

In summary, the official and default directory for Copilot prompt files in both VS Code and Visual Studio is **`.github/prompts`**, and they must use the `.prompt.md` extension. The `.github/copilot/prompts` path is a community convention (and could work if configured accordingly), but it isn’t recognized by default.

## **Q. 04**: where are 'User prompts' handled by VSCode?

After checking the official documentation and recent updates:

1.  **Location of user prompt files**
    *   In **Visual Studio Code**, user-scope prompt files are saved in a dedicated **prompts** folder within your personal VS Code profile. The docs describe that *user prompt files “are available across multiple workspaces and are stored in the current VS Code profile”*. Though the docs do not list explicit paths, typical locations are:
        *   **Windows** (stable VS Code): `%APPDATA%\Code\User\prompts\`
        *   **Windows** (VS Code Insiders): `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders\User\prompts\`
        *   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/prompts/`
        *   **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/prompts/`

    *   These files are *not* tied to a particular repository; they live in your user profile, so they travel with you across different projects. Importantly, **they do not sync to other developers via Git**, but you can enable VS Code's **Settings Sync** to share them across your own devices. [\[code.visua...studio.com\]](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files)

    *   In **Visual Studio (Windows)**, support for prompt files has arrived only in recent versions (Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10+ and Visual Studio 2026). However, Visual Studio does not yet recognize user-scoped prompt files. Instead, it only uses workspace-level prompt files stored in the repository’s `.github/prompts` folder. There is no mechanism in Visual Studio for user-level prompt files similar to VS Code’s profile-based prompts.

2.  **How user prompt files are used by Copilot**
    *   **In VS Code**, your user prompt files appear in Copilot Chat’s prompt picker and as slash commands (e.g., `/my-prompt`) even when you’re working in different projects. You can select them from the prompt dropdown or type the slash command to run the prompt template. They enable you to reuse personal prompts without including them in every repository.
    *   **In Visual Studio**, the current guidance (as of VS 2026) is to place prompt files in `.github/prompts` within your repo and use them with `#promptName` (hashtag commands) or slash commands in chat. There is no mention of user-scope prompt files for Visual Studio, so they are effectively a VS Code-only feature.

In short, **user prompt files** belong in your VS Code profile (e.g. `~/.config/Code/User/prompts/`), and they provide personal, reusable prompts across all your projects in VS Code. These prompt files aren’t synced with your team, but you can use VS Code’s Settings Sync to access them on multiple machines. Visual Studio currently doesn’t support user-scoped prompt files; it recognizes only workspace-level prompts saved in `.github/prompts`. [\[code.visua...studio.com\]](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files)


Q : 05**: which are the differences between
`.github/prompts/` and `.github/copilot/prompts/`?

**A. 05**: According to the official GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio Code documentation, the default and officially supported location for workspace-level prompt files is the **`.github/prompts/`** directory at the root of your repository. Prompt files placed here will be automatically detected by Copilot Chat in VS Code and, as of recent releases, in Visual Studio 2022/2026. You need only save them with a `.prompt.md` extension, and they become available as slash or hashtag commands in the chat.

In contrast, **`.github/copilot/prompts/`** is *not* an official default location recognized by Copilot. Some community guides suggest organizing Copilot-related assets under `.github/copilot/`—for example, adding `knowledge/`, `examples/`, or `prompts/` subfolders for clarity. However, files stored in `.github/copilot/prompts/` will not automatically show up in Copilot Chat unless you explicitly configure VS Code to look there (by adjusting the `chat.promptFilesLocations` setting) or manually attach them. Visual Studio’s documentation makes no mention of this folder; instead, it references `.github/prompts` as the prompt directory.

In short, **`.github/prompts/`** is the official, out-of-the-box location for prompt files in both VS Code and Visual Studio［0†L10-L13］, while **`.github/copilot/prompts/`** is a community convention for grouping Copilot assets that may require extra configuration to work as expected.
