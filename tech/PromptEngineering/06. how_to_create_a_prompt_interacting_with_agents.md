# How to Create a Prompt Orchestrating Multiple Agents

When building complex AI workflows, a single prompt file often isn't enough.  
Tasks like "create a new prompt following best practices" involve multiple distinct phases—research, building, validation, and fixing—each requiring different expertise and tools.  

This article explains how to design an <mark>orchestrator prompt</mark> that coordinates specialized agents, including intelligent architecture analysis to determine when new agents need to be created.

## 🎯 The Problem: Complex Multi-Phase Workflows

Consider the task: **"Create a new prompt file following repository best practices."**

This seemingly simple request actually involves multiple distinct phases:

1. **Research**: Discover existing patterns, find similar prompts, identify conventions
2. **Architecture Analysis**: Determine if a single prompt suffices or if multiple agents are needed
3. **Building**: Generate the actual file(s) following discovered patterns
4. **Validation**: Check structure, conventions, and quality
5. **Fixing**: Address any issues found during validation

Each phase requires different:
- **Tools**: Research needs `semantic_search`, building needs `create_file`, validation needs `read_file`
- **Expertise**: Researcher mindset vs. builder mindset vs. quality auditor mindset
- **Access levels**: Some phases are read-only, others need write access

### The Monolithic Prompt Problem

A single prompt trying to do everything suffers from:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **<mark>Tool Clash</mark>** | 20+ tools cause confusion and wrong tool selection |
| **<mark>Context Rot</mark>** | Instructions for later phases get "lost in the middle" |
| **<mark>Mixed Responsibilities</mark>** | Hard to maintain, debug, or improve individual phases |
| **<mark>No Reusability</mark>** | Can't reuse the "research" capability for other tasks |

### The Solution: Orchestrator + Specialized Agents

Split the monolithic prompt into:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          ORCHESTRATOR PROMPT                                │
│   prompt-design-and-create.prompt.md                        │
│                                                             │
│   • Gathers requirements (Phase 1)                          │
│   • Coordinates agent handoffs                              │
│   • Analyzes architecture needs (Phase 3)                   │
│   • Presents results at each phase                          │
│   • Does NOT implement—delegates everything                 │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┘
                      │
        ┌─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┐

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### The Prompt Creation System

We designed a complete system for creating prompts and agents:

```
ORCHESTRATORS (Prompts)
├── prompt-design-and-create.prompt.md    # Creates NEW prompts/agents
└── prompt-review-and-validate.prompt.md  # Improves EXISTING prompts/agents

SPECIALIZED AGENTS (Prompt Domain)
├── prompt-researcher.agent.md   # Research patterns, recommend templates
├── prompt-builder.agent.md      # Create prompt files
├── prompt-validator.agent.md    # Validate prompt quality
└── prompt-updater.agent.md      # Fix validation issues

SPECIALIZED AGENTS (Agent Domain) - Created when needed
├── agent-researcher.agent.md    # Research agent patterns
├── agent-builder.agent.md       # Create agent files
├── agent-validator.agent.md     # Validate agent quality
└── agent-updater.agent.md       # Fix agent issues
```

### Why Separate Prompt vs. Agent Specialists?

While prompts and agents share similar structure, they have important differences:

| Aspect | Prompt Files | Agent Files |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **<mark>Location</mark>** | `.github/prompts/` | `.github/agents/` |
| **<mark>Extension</mark>** | `.prompt.md` | `.agent.md` |
| **<mark>Key Fields</mark>** | `agent: plan/agent`, `tools` | `tools`, `handoffs`, persona |
| **<mark>Focus</mark>** | Task workflow | Specialist role |
| **<mark>Templates</mark>** | `prompt-*.md` templates | Agent-specific templates |

A `prompt-builder` trained on prompt patterns may not produce optimal agent files. Hence the need for specialized `agent-builder` when creating agents.

### Advanced Agent Deployment Options

Custom agents aren't limited to interactive chat sessions. VS Code v1.107+ provides <mark>**three execution contexts**</mark> for orchestrated workflows, unified through the Agent HQ interface.

#### Execution Contexts Comparison

| Context | Isolation | Workspace Changes | Best For | Orchestration Use Cases |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| **<mark>Local</mark>** | None—modifies workspace directly | Immediate in active workspace | Quick tasks, interactive refinement | Interactive research, immediate validation |
| **<mark>Background</mark>** | Full—uses Git work tree | Isolated, can be applied back | Long-running tasks without blocking | Code generation, multi-file refactoring |
| **<mark>Cloud</mark>** | Full—new branch and PR | Creates pull request | Large changes, async collaboration | Automated PR workflows, scheduled audits |

**Work Tree Isolation (Background Context):**

Background agents automatically create <mark>**Git work trees**</mark> to isolate changes:
- No conflicts with your active workspace edits
- Review changes before applying to main workspace
- Safe parallel execution of validation agents
- One-click "Apply" action to merge changes

**v1.107.1 Enhancements:**
- Side-by-side session view for easier comparison
- Input-required markers to track workflow state
- Workspace change copying support
- Collapsed tool calls in cloud sessions for cleaner output

All three contexts reuse the same `.agent.md` files, making orchestrator patterns fully portable across execution environments.

#### Agent HQ: Unified Session Management

<mark>**Agent HQ**</mark> (introduced in v1.107) provides a unified interface for managing all agent sessions—local, background, and cloud—in one view.

**Key Features for Orchestrations:**

- **Recent Sessions List**: Track all active and completed multi-phase workflows
- **Filtering and Search**: Find specific orchestration runs by name or agent type
- **Read/Unread Markers**: Visual indicators show which sessions need attention
- **Archive Capability**: Clean up completed workflows while preserving history
- **Side-by-Side View**: Compare orchestrator output with specialist agent results (v1.107.1)

**Orchestration Workflow Pattern:**

```
User runs orchestrator prompt
        ↓
Orchestrator gathers requirements (Phase 1-2)
        ↓
Orchestrator shows analysis, prompts:
  "Ready to delegate to specialist agent?"
        ↓
User clicks "Continue in Background/Cloud"
        ↓
Agent HQ shows new session running
        ↓
User continues working in local session
        ↓
Background/cloud session completes
        ↓
Agent HQ marks session as "unread" (needs attention)
        ↓
User reviews results, applies changes
```

**Benefits for Multi-Agent Workflows:**
- **<mark>Parallel Execution</mark>**: Run validation in background while continuing local research
- **<mark>Session Continuity</mark>**: Background sessions persist across VS Code restarts
- **<mark>Clear Handoff Points</mark>**: Visual separation between orchestrator and specialist execution
- **<mark>Audit Trail</mark>**: Complete history of all phases in multi-step workflows

#### The "Continue in" Delegation Pattern

The <mark>**"Continue in"**</mark> workflow is the primary mechanism for orchestrators to delegate work to specialized agents.

**Available From:**
- Chat view "Continue in" button
- Untitled prompt file "Continue in" button
- Agent handoff suggestions

**Delegation Workflow:**

```yaml
# In orchestrator prompt
---
name: prompt-design-and-create
agent: plan  # Planning mode for analysis
---

# Phase 1-2: Gather requirements and research
# Phase 3: Present findings to user

## Delegation Options

Based on analysis, I recommend:

**Option A - Continue in Background:**
- Isolated work tree for safe experimentation
- Review changes before applying
- Continue working while agent builds

**Option B - Continue in Cloud:**
- Automatic PR creation
- Team collaboration via GitHub
- No local resource usage

**Option C - Continue Local (Interactive):**
- Real-time feedback and refinement
- Immediate workspace updates
```

**How Delegation Works:**

1. **User triggers**: Clicks "Continue in Background" or "Continue in Cloud"
2. **Context transfer**: Orchestrator's conversation history transfers to new session
3. **Agent execution**: Specialist agent (e.g., `prompt-builder`) runs in selected context
4. **Notification**: Agent HQ marks session complete when done
5. **Review**: User reviews results in Agent HQ, applies changes if satisfied

**Orchestrator Best Practices:**
- Present delegation options clearly at transition points
- Explain trade-offs between contexts (isolation vs. immediacy)
- Recommend context based on task complexity and duration
- Provide clear success criteria for delegated work

#### Planning Mode Integration

<mark>**Planning mode**</mark> (`agent: plan` in YAML frontmatter) generates implementation plans before delegating to builder agents.

**How Orchestrators Use Planning Mode:**

```yaml
---
name: prompt-design-and-create
agent: plan  # Enable planning mode
---

# Phase 0: Planning (Optional)
Generate implementation plan including:
- File structure recommendations
- Required agent specialists
- Estimated complexity
- Risk assessment

# Phase 1-2: Requirements gathering
...

# Phase 3: Delegate plan to builder agent
Present plan and offer "Continue in" delegation
```

**Benefits for Orchestrations:**
- **Upfront clarity**: Users see complete plan before work begins
- **Better delegation**: Plans specify which specialist agents are needed
- **Risk mitigation**: Identify potential issues before implementation
- **User control**: Review and approve plan before delegating

**Planning → Implementation Workflow:**

```
Orchestrator (planning mode)
        ↓
Generates detailed implementation plan
        ↓
Shows plan to user with delegation options
        ↓
User approves and clicks "Continue in Background"
        ↓
Builder agent executes plan in isolated work tree
        ↓
User reviews completed work in Agent HQ
        ↓
Applies changes to main workspace
```

#### Subagents (Experimental)

VS Code supports <mark>**subagents**</mark>—the ability to spawn child agents from within a parent agent's execution. This enables dynamic orchestration patterns where agents can delegate subtasks programmatically.

```yaml
---
name: code-review-orchestrator
description: "Orchestrates code review workflow"
tools:
  - runSubagent  # Enables spawning child agents
  - read_file
infer: true  # Allow this agent to be used as a subagent (default)
---
```

**Subagent patterns:**
- Parent orchestrator spawns specialized reviewers on-demand
- Dynamic agent selection based on file types discovered
- Recursive workflows where validators can trigger fixers

> **Note:** Subagent support is experimental. Set `infer: false` in agent YAML to prevent an agent from being invoked as a subagent.

### Sharing Agents Across Teams

Orchestrated workflows become more valuable when shared across your organization:

#### Workspace-Level Sharing

Store agents in `.github/agents/` folder—they're automatically available to anyone who clones the repository:

```
repository/
├── .github/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── prompt-researcher.agent.md
│   │   ├── prompt-builder.agent.md
│   │   └── code-review-orchestrator.agent.md
│   └── prompts/
│       └── prompt-design-and-create.prompt.md
```

#### Organization-Level Sharing (Experimental)

For enterprises, VS Code supports <mark>**organization-level custom agents**</mark> defined at the GitHub organization level. These agents appear automatically for all organization members.

**Benefits:**
- Centralized agent libraries maintained by platform teams
- Consistent tooling across all repositories
- Version-controlled agent definitions with org-wide rollout

**Enable discovery:**
```json
// settings.json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.customAgents.showOrganizationAndEnterpriseAgents": true
}
```

Organization agents appear in the Agents dropdown alongside personal and workspace agents.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility: Claude Skills

If your team uses Claude across multiple platforms, VS Code can integrate <mark>**Claude skills**</mark>—reusable instruction sets that work across Claude interfaces.

**How it works:**
- Define skills in `SKILL.md` files
- Store in `~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` (user-level) or `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` (workspace)
- VS Code loads skills on-demand when the `read` tool is enabled

**Example skill structure:**
```markdown
# Code Review Skill

You are an expert code reviewer focused on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance anti-patterns
- Code maintainability

## Process
1. Analyze code structure
2. Identify issues by severity
3. Suggest specific fixes
```

**Enable Claude skills in VS Code:**
```json
// settings.json (experimental)
{
  "chat.useClaudeSkills": true
}
```

**When to use Claude skills vs. custom agents:**

| Feature | Claude Skills | Custom Agents |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Scope** | Cross-platform (Claude.ai, API, VS Code) | VS Code only |
| **Tools** | Limited (`allowed-tools` not supported in VS Code) | Full tool configuration |
| **Handoffs** | Not supported | Full handoff orchestration |
| **Best for** | Portable personas/instructions | Complex orchestrated workflows |

> **Note:** The `allowed-tools` attribute in Claude skills is not currently supported in VS Code. For tool-specific workflows, use custom agents.

## 📋 The Specialized Agent Pattern

Each specialized agent follows a consistent structure:

### Agent Anatomy

```yaml
---
description: "One-sentence specialist description"
agent: plan  # or: agent (for write access)
tools:
  - tool_1    # Narrow scope: 3-7 tools max
  - tool_2
handoffs:
  - label: "Next Step"
    agent: next-agent
    send: true  # automatic or false for user approval
---

# Agent Name

[Role description - what this specialist does]

## Your Expertise
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]

## 🚨 CRITICAL BOUNDARIES

### ✅ Always Do
- [Required behaviors]

### ⚠️ Ask First  
- [Actions requiring confirmation]

### 🚫 Never Do
- [Prohibited actions]

## Process
[Phase-by-phase workflow]
```

### The Four Prompt Specialists

#### 1. prompt-researcher.agent.md
**Role**: Research specialist (read-only)

```yaml
agent: plan  # Read-only
tools:
  - semantic_search
  - read_file
  - file_search
  - grep_search
```

**Responsibilities**:
- Find similar existing prompts (3-5 examples)
- Analyze patterns and conventions
- Recommend appropriate template
- Provide implementation guidance

**Key Boundary**: Never creates or modifies files

#### 2. prompt-builder.agent.md
**Role**: File creation specialist

```yaml
agent: agent  # Write access
tools:
  - read_file
  - semantic_search
  - create_file
  - file_search
handoffs:
  - label: "Validate Prompt"
    agent: prompt-validator
    send: true  # Automatic validation
```

**Responsibilities**:
- Load and customize templates
- Apply research recommendations
- Create new prompt files
- Self-validate before handoff

**Key Boundary**: Creates NEW files only (never modifies existing)

#### 3. prompt-validator.agent.md
**Role**: Quality assurance specialist (read-only)

```yaml
agent: plan  # Read-only
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
  - file_search
```

**Responsibilities**:
- Validate structure against template
- Check convention compliance
- Assess quality and completeness
- Produce detailed report with scores

**Key Boundary**: Never modifies files—only reports issues

#### 4. prompt-updater.agent.md
**Role**: Fix specialist

```yaml
agent: agent  # Write access
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
  - replace_string_in_file
  - multi_replace_string_in_file
handoffs:
  - label: "Re-validate After Update"
    agent: prompt-validator
    send: true  # Automatic re-validation
```

**Responsibilities**:
- Apply fixes from validation report
- Make targeted, surgical changes
- Preserve existing structure
- Trigger re-validation

**Key Boundary**: Modifies EXISTING files only (never creates new)

### Extending Agents with MCP Servers

Custom agents can use tools from [Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enabling access to external systems like databases, APIs, and file systems beyond VS Code's built-in capabilities.

MCP tools are referenced in agent YAML just like built-in tools:

```yaml
---
name: database-analyzer
tools:
  - read_file
  - mcp.database-server.query  # MCP tool
  - mcp.database-server.schema # MCP tool
---
```

**When to use MCP for orchestrations:**
- Agent needs database access (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- External API integration required (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- Custom tools specific to your domain or workflow

Learn more: [VS Code MCP Servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers)

## 🎯 Use Case Challenge Methodology

Before building any prompt or agent, validate that the **goal is clear and actionable** by generating realistic use cases. This battle-tested methodology prevents scope creep and reveals tool/boundary requirements early.

### Why Use Case Challenge?

Goals often seem clear until tested against real scenarios. A prompt like "validate code quality" sounds straightforward, but:
- Does it include security checks?
- Should it analyze test coverage?
- What about documentation completeness?

The **Use Case Challenge** generates 3/5/7 scenarios (based on complexity) to stress-test goal clarity before any implementation begins.

### Complexity Assessment

First, determine task complexity:

| Complexity | Indicators | Use Cases to Generate |
|------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Simple** | Clear single task, standard role, well-defined scope | 3 |
| **Moderate** | Multiple objectives, domain-specific knowledge, some ambiguity | 5 |
| **Complex** | Broad scope, novel workflow, cross-domain expertise needed | 7 |

### Use Case Generation Process

```markdown
### Use Case Challenge Results

**Initial Goal**: [starting goal definition]
**Complexity Level**: [Simple/Moderate/Complex]
**Use Cases Generated**: [3/5/7]

---

**Use Case 1: [Common Case]**
- **Scenario**: User asks to [realistic situation]
- **Test**: Does goal provide clear guidance for this case?
- **Result**: [✅ Clear / ⚠️ Ambiguous / ❌ Gap]
- **Tool Discovered**: [if scenario reveals tool need]
- **Boundary Discovered**: [if scenario reveals scope limit]
- **Refinement**: [specific goal adjustment]

**Use Case 2: [Edge Case]**
[...repeat pattern...]

**Use Case 3: [Conflict Case]**
[...repeat pattern...]

---

**Validation Status**:
- ✅ Goal appropriately scoped → Proceed to Phase 2
- ⚠️ Goal needs refinement → [proposed changes, ask user]
- ❌ Goal fundamentally unclear → BLOCK, ask user for direction

**Refined Goal**: [updated goal definition]
**Tools Discovered**: [list with justifications]
**Scope Boundaries**: 
  - IN: [what's included]
  - OUT: [what's excluded]
```

### Real Example: Prompt Creation Orchestrator

When designing the prompt creation system, the Use Case Challenge revealed:

**Initial Goal**: "Create prompts following best practices"

**Use Case Challenge (5 cases for Moderate complexity)**:

| # | Scenario | Result | Discovery |
|---|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Simple validation prompt | ✅ Clear | Needs template selection |
| 2 | Multi-phase workflow prompt | ⚠️ Ambiguous | When to recommend orchestrator vs. single prompt? |
| 3 | Prompt requiring new agents | ❌ Gap | No guidance on agent creation sub-workflow |
| 4 | Prompt with conflicting requirements | ⚠️ Ambiguous | How to handle tool count >7? |
| 5 | Updating existing prompt | ❌ Gap | Build vs. Update are different workflows |

**Refinements Applied**:
- Split into two orchestrators: `design-and-create` vs. `review-and-validate`
- Added Phase 3 architecture analysis for complexity detection
- Added agent dependency planning phases (5-6)
- Added tool count enforcement with decomposition strategy

### Role Challenge for Agents

When creating agents (not prompts), apply additional **Role Challenge** tests:

```markdown
### Role Challenge Tests

**Agent**: [agent name]
**Initial Role**: [starting role definition]

**Test 1: Authority Test**
- Question: Does this agent have authority to [action]?
- Result: [✅/❌]
- Implication: [adjust boundaries]

**Test 2: Expertise Test**  
- Question: Is this agent the best specialist for [task]?
- Result: [✅/❌]
- Implication: [refine or split role]

**Test 3: Specificity Test**
- Question: Is this role too broad or too narrow?
- Result: [✅/❌]
- Implication: [adjust scope]

**Validated Role**: [final role definition]
```

## 🔀 Orchestrator Design: Phase-Based Coordination

The orchestrator prompt coordinates the workflow through distinct phases, optionally using <mark>planning mode</mark> for upfront design:

### Orchestrator Structure

```yaml
---
name: prompt-create-orchestrator
description: "Orchestrates specialized agents to research, build, and validate"
agent: plan  # Optional: Use planning mode for Phase 0
tools:
  - read_file        # For Phase 1 requirements analysis only
  - semantic_search  # For Phase 3 architecture analysis only
  # Note: Minimal tools for orchestrator - agents have specialized tools
handoffs:
  - label: "Research prompt requirements"
    agent: prompt-researcher
    send: false  # User reviews research
  - label: "Build prompt file"
    agent: prompt-builder
    send: false  # User reviews file
  - label: "Validate prompt quality"
    agent: prompt-validator
    send: true   # Automatic validation
---
```

### Handoff Configuration: `send: true` vs `send: false`

| Configuration | Behavior | Use When |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| `send: false` | User sees output, decides whether to proceed | User should review intermediate results |
| `send: true` | Automatic handoff, no user intervention | High confidence, routine validation |

**Our Pattern**:
- Research → User reviews findings (`send: false`)
- Build → User reviews file (`send: false`)
- Validate → Automatic, builder self-checked (`send: true`)
- Fix → Automatic re-validation (`send: true`)

## 🧠 Structure Definition & Architecture Analysis (Phase 3)

The orchestrator's most important job is **determining optimal architecture** for the task. This happens in Phase 3, which now includes tool composition validation and agent dependency planning.

### The Architecture Decision Problem

When a user requests "Create a prompt for code review," should we create:

**Option A: Single Prompt**
- One file: `code-review.prompt.md`
- Contains all logic in one place
- Simpler but potentially bloated

**Option B: Orchestrator + Agents**
- Orchestrator: `code-review-orchestrator.prompt.md`
- Agents: `security-reviewer.agent.md`, `style-reviewer.agent.md`, etc.
- More complex but modular and reusable

### Phase 3: Architecture Analysis Process

```markdown
### Phase 3: Prompt and Agent Structure Definition (Orchestrator)

**Goal:** Analyze task requirements to determine optimal architecture.

#### 1. Task Complexity Assessment

Analyze requirements from Phase 1 and research from Phase 2:

**Multi-phase workflow?**
- Does task divide into distinct phases? (analyze → execute → validate)
- Are phases sequential with clear handoff points?

**Cross-domain expertise?**
- Does task span multiple domains? (code, tests, docs)
- Would different specialists have different tool needs?

**Complexity Level:**
- **Low**: Single focused task, one domain
- **Medium**: 2-3 steps, same tools
- **High**: 3+ phases, multiple domains, different tools per phase
```

### Decision Framework

| Criteria | Single Prompt | Orchestrator + Agents |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Phases** | 1-2 linear steps | 3+ distinct phases |
| **Domains** | Single domain | Cross-domain |
| **Tools** | Consistent tools | Different tools per phase |
| **Existing agents** | None applicable | 1+ agents reusable |
| **New agents** | None justified | Reusable specialists identified |
| **Complexity** | Low-Medium | Medium-High |

### Existing Agent Inventory

Before recommending new agents, the orchestrator checks what already exists:

```markdown
#### 2. Existing Agent Inventory

Search `.github/agents/` directory for applicable agents:

1. List all agents: `file_search` in `.github/agents/*.agent.md`
2. Read agent descriptions (YAML frontmatter + purpose sections)
3. Match agent capabilities to task phases
4. Evaluate: Can existing agents be reused or extended?

**Analysis output:**

### Existing Agents Applicable to Task

**Directly applicable:**
- `prompt-researcher` → Research phase (100% match)
- `prompt-validator` → Validation phase (100% match)

**Coverage:** 50% existing, 25% new, 25% orchestrator-only
```

### New Agent Opportunities

When existing agents don't cover all phases:

```markdown
#### 3. New Agent Opportunities

**Criteria for new agent:**
- [ ] Represents reusable specialist persona (not task-specific)
- [ ] Has distinct tool needs from other agents
- [ ] Could be coordinated by multiple orchestrators
- [ ] Has clear boundaries and single responsibility

**Anti-patterns (don't create agent):**
- Task-specific logic with no reuse potential
- Same tools as existing agent (extend instead)
- One-off implementation need

**Recommendation:**

### Recommended New Agents

**Agent 1: security-analyzer.agent.md**
- **Purpose:** Analyze code for security vulnerabilities
- **Reusability:** Security audits, PR reviews, compliance checks
- **Justification:** Distinct expertise, reusable across multiple workflows
```

### Tool Composition Validation

Before finalizing architecture, validate tool composition to prevent common failures:

```markdown
### Tool Composition Validation Report

**Prompt/Agent**: [name]
**Agent Mode**: [plan/agent]

#### 1. Tool Count Check
**Count**: [N] tools
- ✅ 3-7 tools: Optimal scope
- ⚠️ <3 tools: May be insufficient for task
- ❌ >7 tools: Tool clash risk - MUST decompose

**If >7 tools detected:**
→ Decompose into orchestrator + specialized agents
→ Each agent gets subset of tools (3-7 each)
→ Re-run architecture analysis

#### 2. Agent/Tool Alignment Check

| Agent Mode | Allowed Tools | Status |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| `plan` | Read-only tools only | [✅/❌] |
| `agent` | Read + Write tools | [✅/❌] |

**Write tools** (require `agent: agent`):
- `create_file`
- `replace_string_in_file`
- `multi_replace_string_in_file`
- `run_in_terminal`

**Alignment failures:**
- `plan` + write tools → ❌ FAIL (agent can't execute writes)
- `agent` + only read tools → ⚠️ Warning (may be intentional, but verify)

#### 3. Tool Redundancy Check
- Overlapping capabilities: [list any]
- Recommendation: [consolidate or justify]

**Validation Result**: [✅ PASSED / ⚠️ WARNINGS / ❌ FAILED]
```

### Agent Dependencies Planning (Phases 5-6)

When Phase 3 identifies agent dependencies, dedicated phases plan their creation:

#### Phase 5: Agent Update Planning

For **existing agents** that need modification:

```markdown
## Phase 5: Agent Updates Required

### Update Queue

**1. prompt-researcher.agent.md**
- **Change Type**: Behavioral
- **Changes**: Add use case challenge validation to research output
- **Impact**: Low - additive only
- **Approval**: Required before proceeding

**2. prompt-validator.agent.md**
- **Change Type**: Structural  
- **Changes**: Add tool alignment validation checks
- **Impact**: Medium - affects validation output format
- **Approval**: Required before proceeding

### Change Impact Categories

| Category | Definition | Approval |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Structural** | Changes file organization, sections, or YAML | Required |
| **Behavioral** | Changes what agent does or how | Required |
| **Cosmetic** | Formatting, typos, clarifications | Optional |
| **Fix** | Addresses validation failure | Auto-approved |

**Approve update plan? (yes/no/modify)**
```

#### Phase 6: New Agent Creation Planning

For **new agents** that need to be created:

```markdown
## Phase 6: New Agent Creation Plan

### Agents to Create

**1. agent-researcher.agent.md**
- **Purpose**: Research agent patterns and conventions
- **Role**: Read-only specialist for agent domain
- **Tools**: [semantic_search, read_file, file_search, grep_search]
- **Agent mode**: plan (read-only)
- **Boundaries**:
  - Always: Search .github/agents/ first
  - Ask First: When no similar agents found
  - Never: Create or modify files
- **Handoffs**: None (returns to orchestrator)
- **Template**: agent-researcher-template.md

**2. agent-builder.agent.md**
- **Purpose**: Create new agent files
- **Role**: Write specialist for agent domain
- **Tools**: [read_file, semantic_search, create_file, file_search]
- **Agent mode**: agent (write access)
- **Boundaries**:
  - Always: Follow template structure
  - Ask First: When tool count approaches 7
  - Never: Modify existing agents
- **Handoffs**: → agent-validator (send: true)
- **Template**: agent-builder-template.md

### Recursion Control

**Maximum recursion depth**: 2 levels
- Level 0: Main orchestrator creates prompt
- Level 1: Prompt creation requires new agent
- Level 2: Agent creation can use existing agents only

❌ If Level 2 requires new agents → STOP, escalate to user

### Processing Recommendation

Create agents using: `@agent-design-and-create`

**Approve creation plan? (yes/no/modify)**
```

## 🔧 Handling Agent Creation Within the Workflow

When Phase 3 determines that new agents are needed, the workflow branches:

### Modified Build Phase

```
Phase 3 Output: "Orchestrator + Agents" recommended
    │
    │ New agents needed: 2
    │ Existing agents reusable: 2
    │
    ▼
Phase 4a: Create New Agents (Iterative)
    │
    │ For each new agent:
    │   → Research agent patterns (prompt-researcher)
    │   → Build agent file (agent-builder)
    │   → Validate agent (agent-validator)
    │   → User reviews
    │
    ▼
Phase 4b: Create Orchestrator
    │
    │ Build orchestrator that coordinates:
    │   - Existing agents
    │   - Newly created agents
    │
    ▼
Phase 5: Validate All Files
```

### The Agent Creation Sub-Workflow

When creating agents, we need **agent-specific specialists**:

```yaml
# Phase 4a handoff for each new agent
handoff:
  label: "Build agent file: security-analyzer"
  agent: agent-builder  # NOT prompt-builder!
  send: false
  context: |
    Build new agent file from Phase 3 recommendations.
    
    Agent specifications:
    - Name: security-analyzer
    - Purpose: Analyze code for security vulnerabilities
    - Persona: Security expert
    - Tools: [read_file, grep_search, semantic_search]
    - Agent type: plan (read-only analysis)
    
    Create file at: .github/agents/security-analyzer.agent.md
```

### Why Separate `agent-builder` from `prompt-builder`?

| Aspect | prompt-builder | agent-builder |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Output location** | `.github/prompts/` | `.github/agents/` |
| **Template knowledge** | Prompt templates | Agent templates |
| **Key patterns** | Phase workflows, tool lists | Personas, handoffs, expertise |
| **YAML focus** | `agent:`, `tools:`, `argument-hint:` | `tools:`, `handoffs:`, `description:` |

The builder needs domain-specific knowledge to produce optimal files.

### Iterative Agent Creation

When multiple agents are needed, create them iteratively:

```markdown
## Phase 4a Progress: Agent Creation

**Agents to create:** 2
**Agents completed:** 1

### Agent 1: security-analyzer.agent.md
**Status:** ✅ Created
**Path:** `.github/agents/security-analyzer.agent.md`
**Tools:** [read_file, grep_search, semantic_search]

### Agent 2: performance-analyzer.agent.md
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress

**Proceed with Agent 2? (yes/no/review Agent 1)**
```

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Orchestrator Never Implements

The orchestrator's only jobs are:
- Gather requirements
- Analyze architecture
- Hand off to specialists
- Present results

**Why?** Keeps orchestrator focused, prevents context bloat, ensures specialists have full context for their domain.

### 2. Builder Creates, Updater Modifies

Clear separation of responsibilities:

| Action | Agent |
|--------|-------|
| Create NEW file | `prompt-builder` or `agent-builder` |
| Modify EXISTING file | `prompt-updater` or `agent-updater` |

**Why?** Prevents accidental overwrites, different tools needed (create_file vs. replace_string_in_file).

### 3. Automatic Validation After Build

```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Validate"
    agent: prompt-validator
    send: true  # Automatic
```

**Why?** Builder already self-checks, validation is routine, reduces user fatigue.

### 4. Automatic Re-validation After Fix

```yaml
# In prompt-updater
handoffs:
  - label: "Re-validate After Update"
    agent: prompt-validator
    send: true  # Automatic
```

**Why?** Ensures fixes actually resolved issues, creates feedback loop.

### 5. User Approval for Research and Build

```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Research"
    agent: prompt-researcher
    send: false  # User reviews
  - label: "Build"
    agent: prompt-builder
    send: false  # User reviews
```

**Why?** User should validate research direction and review generated files before validation.

### Validation Loop Limits

Validation/fix cycles can loop indefinitely without limits. Apply these constraints:

```markdown
### Validation Loop Rules

**Maximum iterations**: 3
**Current iteration**: [1/2/3]

**After each iteration:**
- Iteration 1: Apply fixes, re-validate automatically
- Iteration 2: Apply fixes, re-validate automatically  
- Iteration 3: If still failing → STOP, escalate to user

**Escalation message:**
"Validation failed after 3 fix attempts. Issues remaining:
- [issue 1]
- [issue 2]

Options:
1. Continue with current state (acknowledge issues)
2. Manually review and provide guidance
3. Abandon and restart with different approach"
```

**Why?** Prevents infinite loops when validation and fixing can't converge on a solution.

### Pre-Save Validation

Builders must self-validate **before** saving files to catch issues early:

```markdown
### Pre-Save Validation Checklist

**Before saving file, verify:**

- [ ] **Tool count**: [N] tools (MUST be 3-7)
      - If <3: Verify task is narrow enough
      - If >7: STOP → decompose into multiple agents

- [ ] **Agent mode / tool alignment**:
      - `plan` + write tools = ❌ FAIL
      - `agent` + only read tools = ⚠️ Verify intentional

- [ ] **Three-tier boundaries complete**:
      - ✅ Always Do section present
      - ⚠️ Ask First section present  
      - 🚫 Never Do section present

- [ ] **Bottom metadata block present** (for articles)

- [ ] **Examples included** (minimum 2 usage examples)

**If any critical check fails**: STOP, report issue, do not save
```

**Why?** Catching issues before file creation is cheaper than validation/fix cycles.

## 🎛️ Context Engineering for Orchestrators

Multi-agent workflows can exceed token limits without optimization. Apply these patterns:

### Lazy Loading Pattern

Orchestrators should **not** preload all context in Phase 1:

❌ **Inefficient:**
```markdown
Phase 1: Read all templates, all context files, all existing agents
```

✅ **Efficient:**
```markdown
Phase 1: Gather requirements only
Phase 2: Agent loads only relevant templates
Phase 3: Agent accesses only needed context
```

### Context Caching

When an agent is active, search results are cached in the conversation:
- First `semantic_search` indexes relevant files
- Subsequent `read_file` calls on same files reuse context
- Switch agents only when role truly changes

### Tool Selection Optimization

Use narrow tool scopes per agent:
- **Orchestrator**: `[read_file, semantic_search]` only (Phase 1 analysis)
- **Specialist agents**: 3-7 tools max per agent
- **Avoid** giving all agents all tools (causes "tool clash")

### Handling Large Tool Sets

When orchestrations involve many MCP servers:
- VS Code supports **virtual tools** (automatic loading when >128 tools)
- Use **tool sets** to group related MCP + built-in tools
- Configure threshold via `github.copilot.chat.virtualTools.threshold` setting

## 📝 Implementation Example

### The Orchestrator YAML

```yaml
---
name: prompt-design-and-create
description: "Orchestrate prompt file design and creation using specialized agents with use case challenge validation"
agent: agent
model: claude-sonnet-4.5
tools:
  - read_file        # Phase 1: Requirements analysis
  - semantic_search  # Phase 3: Architecture analysis
handoffs:
  - label: "Research prompt requirements and patterns"
    agent: prompt-researcher
    send: false  # User reviews research findings
  - label: "Build prompt file from validated specification"
    agent: prompt-builder
    send: false  # User reviews created file
  - label: "Build agent file from validated specification"
    agent: agent-builder
    send: false  # User reviews created agent
  - label: "Validate prompt quality and compliance"
    agent: prompt-validator
    send: true   # Automatic validation after build
  - label: "Validate agent quality and compliance"
    agent: agent-validator
    send: true   # Automatic validation after build
  - label: "Fix validation issues"
    agent: prompt-updater
    send: false  # User reviews fixes if issues persist
argument-hint: 'Describe the prompt purpose: what task it should accomplish, expected inputs/outputs, any constraints'
---

# Prompt Design and Create Orchestrator

You coordinate specialized agents to design and create prompt files following repository best practices.

## 🚨 CRITICAL BOUNDARIES

### ✅ Always Do
- Gather complete requirements before any handoffs
- Challenge goals with use cases before accepting
- Wait for user approval at each phase transition
- Delegate all research/build/validate/update to specialists
- Validate files before declaring completion

### ⚠️ Ask First
- When requirements are ambiguous after use case challenge
- When Phase 3 identifies agent dependencies
- When validation finds critical issues (>3 iterations)

### 🚫 Never Do
- NEVER skip requirements gathering (Phase 1)
- NEVER skip use case challenge validation
- NEVER build without approved specification
- NEVER skip validation phase
- NEVER implement yourself - orchestrate only
```

### Phase 3 Architecture Decision Output

```markdown
## Phase 3 Complete: Architecture Analysis

### Task Complexity
**Level:** High
**Phases identified:** 4
- Phase 1: Security analysis
- Phase 2: Style review
- Phase 3: Performance analysis
- Phase 4: Test coverage check

**Domains:** [security, style, performance, testing]
**Tool variation:** Yes (different tools per phase)

### Agent Inventory
**Existing agents applicable:** 0
**New agents recommended:** 4
- `security-reviewer` → Phase 1 (reusable for: security audits)
- `style-reviewer` → Phase 2 (reusable for: PR reviews)
- `performance-reviewer` → Phase 3 (reusable for: optimization)
- `test-reviewer` → Phase 4 (reusable for: coverage checks)

### Architecture Recommendation

**Recommended approach:** Orchestrator + Agents

**Justification:**
Task has 4 distinct phases spanning multiple domains. Each phase benefits from specialized expertise and different tool sets. All 4 proposed agents are highly reusable for other workflows.

**Implementation strategy:**
1. Create 4 new agents first (Phase 4a)
2. Create orchestrator to coordinate them (Phase 4b)
3. Validate all files (Phase 5)

**Proceed to build phase? (yes/no/modify)**
```

### Real Validator Output Format

Validators produce structured reports that enable automated fix cycles:

```markdown
## Validation Report: prompt-design-and-create.prompt.md

**Overall Status**: ⚠️ WARNINGS (1 critical, 2 minor)
**Validation Iteration**: 1/3

### Agent-Specific Checks

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Tool Count | ✅ PASS | 2 tools (within 3-7 range for orchestrator) |
| Agent/Tool Alignment | ✅ PASS | `agent` mode with read-only tools (intentional) |
| Handoff Validity | ✅ PASS | 6 handoffs, all targets exist |
| Three-Tier Boundaries | ✅ PASS | Always/Ask/Never sections present |

### Structure Checks

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|--------|
| YAML Frontmatter | ✅ PASS | All required fields present |
| Description Length | ⚠️ WARN | 98 chars (recommend <80) |
| Role Section | ✅ PASS | Clear specialist description |
| Process Section | ✅ PASS | Phases documented |

### Content Checks

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Examples Included | ❌ FAIL | 0 examples (minimum 2 required) |
| Boundary Specificity | ⚠️ WARN | "Never Do" could be more specific |

### Issues Summary

**Critical (must fix)**:
1. Missing usage examples - add at least 2 examples

**Minor (should fix)**:
2. Description exceeds 80 characters
3. "Never Do" boundaries could reference specific anti-patterns

### Recommended Actions

```yaml
fixes:
  - type: "add_section"
    location: "after Process section"
    content: "## Usage Examples\n\n### Example 1: Simple Prompt...\n### Example 2: Complex Orchestration..."
  - type: "edit"
    target: "description"
    current: "Orchestrate prompt file design and creation using specialized agents with use case challenge validation"
    proposed: "Orchestrate prompt creation with specialized agents and use case validation"
```

**Handoff to updater? (auto if critical issues)**
```

## 📊 Real Implementation Case Study

The patterns in this article were battle-tested by designing and implementing a complete prompt/agent creation system. The case study documents:

### What Was Built

- **4 Orchestration Prompts**:
  - `prompt-design-and-create.prompt.md` - Creates new prompts/agents
  - `prompt-review-and-validate.prompt.md` - Improves existing prompts/agents
  - `agent-design-and-create.prompt.md` - Creates new agents specifically
  - `agent-review-and-validate.prompt.md` - Improves existing agents

- **8 Specialized Agents** (4 for prompts, 4 for agents):
  - Researchers (read-only pattern discovery)
  - Builders (file creation)
  - Validators (quality assurance)
  - Updaters (targeted fixes)

### Lessons Learned

| Challenge | Solution Applied |
|-----------|------------------|
| Goals seemed clear but failed edge cases | Use Case Challenge methodology (3/5/7 scenarios) |
| Tool count exceeded 7 in initial designs | Tool Composition Validation with decomposition |
| Validation/fix loops didn't converge | Maximum 3 iterations before escalating |
| Agents created with wrong mode/tool combos | Agent/tool alignment validation (`plan` + write = FAIL) |
| Recursive agent creation caused complexity explosion | Maximum recursion depth: 2 levels |
| File changes without user awareness | Explicit approval checkpoints at each phase |

### Success Metrics Achieved

- **Reliability**: 100% of created files pass validation within 3 iterations
- **Quality**: All agents have complete three-tier boundaries
- **Workflow**: Clear approval checkpoints prevent unwanted changes
- **Reusability**: Agents used across multiple orchestrators

## 🎯 Conclusion

Building complex AI workflows requires moving beyond monolithic prompts to orchestrated multi-agent systems. The key principles are:

### Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent does one thing well
2. **Narrow Tool Scope**: 3-7 tools per agent maximum (enforced)
3. **Clear Handoffs**: Explicit transitions between agents with approval checkpoints
4. **Use Case Challenge**: Validate goals with 3/5/7 scenarios before building
5. **Architecture Intelligence**: Orchestrator analyzes complexity before building
6. **Tool Composition Validation**: `plan` + write tools = automatic failure
7. **Iterative Creation**: Build agents one at a time with validation
8. **Validation Loop Limits**: Maximum 3 fix iterations before escalating
9. **Pre-Save Validation**: Builders self-check before creating files
10. **Context Optimization**: Lazy loading, context caching, minimal orchestrator tools
```

### The Pattern

```
Orchestrator (coordinates, never implements)
    │
    ├── Researcher (read-only, discovers patterns)
    ├── Builder (write, creates new files, pre-validates)
    ├── Validator (read-only, checks quality, max 3 iterations)
    └── Updater (write, fixes issues)
```

### When to Use This Pattern

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Simple, focused task | Single prompt file |
| Multi-phase workflow | Orchestrator + existing agents |
| Complex, multi-domain task | Orchestrator + new specialized agents |
| Improving existing prompts | Different orchestrator (review-and-validate) |

By following this pattern, you create maintainable, reusable, and reliable AI workflows that scale with complexity.

# ⚠️ Common Mistakes in Multi-Agent Orchestration

Orchestrating multiple agents introduces complexity beyond single-agent workflows. These mistakes can cause coordination failures, context loss, or frustrating user experiences.

## Mistake 1: Unclear Orchestration Responsibility

**Problem**: Confusion about whether the prompt or the agent controls workflow progression.

**❌ Bad example:**
```yaml
# orchestrator.prompt.md
---
agent: planner
---

Plan the implementation, then hand off to @developer.
```

```yaml
# planner.agent.md
---
handoffs:
  - label: "Implement"
    agent: developer
---

Create a plan. Then hand off to developer agent.
```

**Problem:** Both prompt AND agent try to control handoff → duplicate instructions, unclear flow.

**✅ Solution: Orchestrator prompt controls flow, agents execute:**
```yaml
# orchestrator.prompt.md
---
name: feature-workflow
agent: planner
---

# Multi-Phase Feature Implementation

## Phase 1: Planning (@planner)

Create detailed implementation plan.

**When plan is ready:** Hand off to @developer with:
"Implement the plan above, following all specified requirements."

## Phase 2: Implementation (@developer)

[Developer implements]

**When code is ready:** Hand off to @test-specialist with:
"Generate comprehensive tests for this implementation."

## Phase 3: Testing (@test-specialist)

[Tester creates tests]

**Final step:** Hand off to @code-reviewer for merge readiness assessment.
```

```yaml
# planner.agent.md
---
handoffs:
  - label: "Start Implementation"
    agent: developer
    send: false
---

Create implementation plans. The orchestrator prompt controls when to proceed.
```

## Mistake 2: Context Loss Between Handoffs

**Problem**: Critical information from earlier phases gets lost when transitioning between agents.

**❌ Bad example:**
```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Test"
    agent: test-specialist
    prompt: "Write tests"
```

**Problem:** Test specialist doesn't know:
- What was implemented
- What requirements it must satisfy
- What edge cases to cover

**✅ Solution: Explicit context carryover in handoff prompts:**
```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Generate Tests"
    agent: test-specialist
    prompt: |
      Create comprehensive tests for the implementation above.
      
      **Requirements to validate:**
      ${requirements}
      
      **Edge cases identified during planning:**
      ${edgeCases}
      
      **Expected behavior:**
      ${expectedBehavior}
      
      Generate tests that verify all requirements and edge cases.
```

## Mistake 3: Too Many Sequential Handoffs

**Problem**: Creating workflows with 6+ sequential handoffs creates slow, fragile chains.

**❌ Bad example:**
```yaml
Phase 1: Requirements Analyst
  ↓
Phase 2: Technical Architect
  ↓
Phase 3: Database Designer
  ↓
Phase 4: API Designer
  ↓
Phase 5: Frontend Developer
  ↓
Phase 6: Test Engineer
  ↓
Phase 7: Security Auditor
  ↓
Phase 8: Performance Optimizer
  ↓
Phase 9: Documentation Writer
```

**Problems:**
- 9 context switches
- High chance of failure at any step
- Context dilution
- Slow execution

**✅ Solution: Consolidate related phases, parallelize when possible:**
```yaml
Phase 1: Planning Agent
  - Requirements analysis
  - Technical architecture
  - Database and API design (combined)
  ↓
Phase 2: Implementation Agent
  - Frontend and backend together
  - Security patterns included
  ↓
Phase 3: Quality Agent
  - Testing + performance review (combined)
  - Documentation generation
```

**Reduced to 3 phases, each handling related concerns.**

## Mistake 4: No Failure Recovery Strategy

**Problem**: Workflow has no path forward when an agent can't complete its task.

**❌ Bad example:**
```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Deploy"
    agent: deployment-agent
    send: true
```

**What happens if deployment fails?** No fallback, no alternative path.

**✅ Solution: Include fallback handoffs or user intervention points:**
```yaml
## Phase 4: Deployment (@deployment-agent)

Deploy to staging environment.

**On success:** Hand off to @smoke-tester for validation.

**On failure:** Hand off to @troubleshooter with:
"Deployment failed with error: [error details]. Diagnose and suggest fixes."

**If troubleshooting doesn't resolve:** Return control to user for manual intervention.
```

```yaml
# deployment-agent.agent.md
---
handoffs:
  - label: "Validate Deployment"
    agent: smoke-tester
    prompt: "Run smoke tests on staging deployment"
  - label: "Troubleshoot Failure"
    agent: troubleshooter
    prompt: "Diagnose deployment failure: ${error}"
---
```

## Mistake 5: Mixing Orchestration Levels

**Problem**: Creating orchestrators that call other orchestrators, creating confusing nested workflows.

**❌ Bad example:**
```yaml
# master-orchestrator.prompt.md
agent: planning-orchestrator  # Calls another orchestrator

# planning-orchestrator.agent.md
handoffs:
  - agent: implementation-orchestrator  # Calls yet another orchestrator

# implementation-orchestrator.agent.md
handoffs:
  - agent: developer  # Finally, a real agent
```

**Result:** 3 levels of orchestration before actual work starts.

**✅ Solution: One orchestrator, specialized agents:**
```yaml
# feature-workflow.prompt.md (SINGLE orchestrator)
agent: planner

Phase 1: @planner - Create plan
  ↓
Phase 2: @developer - Implement
  ↓
Phase 3: @tester - Test
  ↓
Phase 4: @reviewer - Review
```

**Rule:** One orchestrator (prompt file) → Multiple execution agents (agent files)

## Mistake 6: Hardcoded Agent Names

**Problem**: Orchestrator references specific agent names that might not exist in all projects.

**❌ Bad example:**
```yaml
Hand off to @react-specialist for component implementation.
```

**Problem:** Project might use Vue, or might not have `@react-specialist` agent defined.

**✅ Solution: Document required agents, provide defaults:**
```yaml
---
name: component-workflow
description: "Multi-phase component implementation"
---

# Component Implementation Workflow

**Required agents:**
- `@designer` or `@planner` - Creates component specification
- `@developer` - Implements component (any framework)
- `@test-specialist` - Generates tests

**If custom agents don't exist:** Falls back to `@agent` mode.

## Phase 1: Design (@designer)

Create component specification...

**Handoff:** @developer (or default @agent if @developer doesn't exist)
```

## Mistake 7: No User Checkpoint Before Destructive Operations

**Problem**: Orchestrator auto-progresses through destructive or irreversible steps.

**❌ Bad example:**
```yaml
Phase 3: @deployment-agent
  send: true  # Automatically deploys without user review
```

**✅ Solution: Explicit checkpoints before high-risk operations:**
```yaml
## Phase 3: Deployment Preparation (@deployment-agent)

Prepare deployment artifacts and configuration.

**USER CHECKPOINT:**

⚠️ **Review the deployment plan above before proceeding.**

Verify:
- [ ] Target environment is correct
- [ ] Database migrations are safe
- [ ] Rollback plan is clear

**When ready to deploy:** Click "Deploy to Production" handoff below.

handoffs:
  - label: "Deploy to Production"
    agent: deployment-agent
    prompt: "Execute deployment with user approval"
    send: false  # User must click to proceed
```

## Mistake 8: Poor Handoff Prompt Quality

**Problem**: Handoff prompts are too generic, providing insufficient context for next agent.

**❌ Bad examples:**
```yaml
prompt: "Continue"            # What should agent continue?
prompt: "Do your thing"       # What thing?
prompt: "Next phase"          # What is the next phase?
```

**✅ Solution: Specific, actionable handoff prompts:**
```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Generate Tests"
    prompt: |
      Create comprehensive test suite for the ${componentName} component implemented above.
      
      **Test coverage requirements:**
      - Unit tests for all public methods
      - Integration tests for component interactions
      - Edge cases: null inputs, empty arrays, error conditions
      
      **Testing framework:** Jest with React Testing Library
      
      **Success criteria:** 80%+ code coverage, all edge cases handled
```

## Mistake 9: Ignoring Agent Execution Context

**Problem**: Not considering where agents run (local vs. background vs. cloud).

**❌ Bad example (assumes all agents run locally):**
```yaml
Phase 1: @planner (local)
Phase 2: @developer (background)  # Has isolated work tree
Phase 3: @reviewer (local)         # Can't see background changes!
```

**Problem:** Background agents work in isolated work trees; local agents can't see their changes until merged.

**✅ Solution: Match workflow to execution context:**
```yaml
# Option 1: All local (synchronous, visible)
Phase 1: @planner (local)
Phase 2: @developer (local)
Phase 3: @reviewer (local)

# Option 2: Background with merge points
Phase 1: @planner (local)
Phase 2: @developer (background - creates PR)
  → USER reviews PR
Phase 3: @reviewer (local - after PR merged)

# Option 3: All cloud (GitHub PR workflow)
Phase 1: @pr-analyzer (cloud)
Phase 2: @security-scanner (cloud)
Phase 3: @approval-agent (cloud)
```

## Key Takeaways

✅ **DO:**
- Let orchestrator prompt control workflow; agents execute tasks
- Include explicit context in handoff prompts
- Consolidate related phases (aim for 3-5, not 9+)
- Provide fallback paths for failures
- Use single orchestrator layer, not nested orchestrators
- Document required agents with fallback options
- Add user checkpoints before destructive operations
- Write specific, actionable handoff prompts
- Match workflow design to agent execution contexts

❌ **DON'T:**
- Split control between prompt and agent
- Lose context between handoffs
- Create excessively long sequential chains
- Omit failure recovery strategies
- Nest orchestrators multiple levels deep
- Hardcode agent names without fallbacks
- Auto-progress through high-risk operations
- Use vague handoff prompts like "continue"
- Ignore execution context differences

By avoiding these orchestration mistakes, you'll build robust multi-agent workflows that handle complexity gracefully, recover from failures, and provide clear user control points.
