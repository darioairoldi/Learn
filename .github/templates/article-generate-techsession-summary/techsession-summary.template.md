## Session Content

<!--
STRUCTURE GUIDANCE — Topic sections

Headings are CONCEPT-DRIVEN, not timestamp-driven.
  ✅  ### Architecture Patterns
  ❌  ### [29:30] Architecture Patterns

Timestamps and speakers appear as metadata BELOW the heading,
only when available.

When a concept is discussed at multiple points or by multiple speakers,
consolidate into ONE section. Note all relevant timestamps and speakers.

Speaker attribution is optional — include only when known and meaningful.

Demos get a brief outcome summary, not step-by-step walkthroughs.
