## Session Content (Chronological)

<!--
STRUCTURE GUIDANCE — Time-based sections

This is a CHRONOLOGICAL analysis. Sections follow session timeline order.

HEADING RULES:
  ✅  ## 1. Architecture Overview
  ❌  ## [00:05:30] Architecture Overview
  Timestamps appear as metadata BELOW the heading, never in the heading.

SPEAKER + TIMEFRAME as metadata:
  **Timeframe:** HH:MM:SS – HH:MM:SS (Xm Ys)
  **Speakers:** Name (Role)

DEMO HANDLING:
  - Mention the demo briefly in the main section (what was shown, key outcome)
  - Add "→ See [Appendix X](#appendix-x-title) for detailed breakdown"
  - Create a dedicated appendix section with step-by-step analysis

TANGENTIAL DISCUSSIONS:
  - Do NOT include in main flow
  - Move to Appendix with proper context label
  - Reference from main flow if relevant: "→ See [Appendix Y](#appendix-y-title)"

SUBSECTIONS:
  Use ### for subtopics within a time-based section.
  Subsections can also have their own timeframe metadata.

TECHNICAL DEPTH:
  For each concept discussed, include when relevant:
  - Definition/explanation as used in the session
  - Key insights and speaker perspective
  - Accuracy assessment: ✓ Verified | ⚠ Needs verification | ✗ Inaccurate
  - Practical applicability and implications

CONTENT ENRICHMENT:
  When the session assumes audience knowledge or mentions a concept briefly:
  - Add a `> **Context:**` callout block with 2-4 sentences of verified background
  - Place enrichment immediately after the first meaningful mention of the concept
  - Use enrichment SELECTIVELY — only where it genuinely helps readers understand
  - Draw from official docs or verified community sources (cite in References)
  - Do NOT enrich self-explanatory concepts or over-explain common terms
  - Do NOT invent definitions — use verified sources only
  Example:
    > **Context:** Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that
    > simplifies packaging, deploying, and managing scalable microservices and
    > containers. It powers core Azure services including Azure SQL Database and
    > Cosmos DB. ([Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/))
