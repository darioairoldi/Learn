## 📖 Overview

**Quarto** is a powerful, **open-source** **scientific** and **technical publishing system** that allows you to create <mark>beautiful documentation websites</mark> from <mark>Markdown files</mark>.<br>
When combined with modern hosting platforms, it provides an excellent solution for publishing and maintaining project documentation.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### 1. Project Structure

Quarto is highly flexible and supports multiple project structures. 

Here are several common approaches:

#### Standard Documentation Structure

A typical Quarto documentation project follows this structure:

```text
your-repo/
├── src/
│   └── doc/           # Source markdown files
│       ├── index.md
│       ├── guide.md
│       └── reference.md
├── docs/              # Rendered HTML output (for GitHub Pages)
├── _quarto.yml        # Quarto configuration file
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── quarto-publish.yml  # GitHub Actions workflow
```

#### Root-Level Structure

For simpler projects, you can place content directly in the root:

```text
your-repo/
├── index.md           # Homepage
├── guide.md           # Documentation pages
├── reference.md
├── about.md
├── docs/              # Rendered output
├── _quarto.yml        # Configuration
└── images/            # Assets
```

#### Learn Repository Structure Example

For a repository like your "Learn" repo with existing folder structure, you could adapt it as follows:

```text
Learn/                              # Your existing repository
├── index.md                        # New: Main landing page
├── _quarto.yml                     # New: Quarto configuration
├── docs/                           # New: Rendered output
├── 202506 Build 2025/              # Existing: Event documentation
│   ├── index.md                    # New: Build 2025 overview
│   ├── BRK106/
│   │   └── *.md                    # Existing: Session notes
│   └── BRK122/
│       └── *.md                    # Existing: Session notes
├── 20250702 Azure Naming conventions/  # Existing: Topic folder
│   └── *.md                        # Existing: Content
├── 20250704 TableStorageAccess options/  # Existing: Topic folder
│   └── *.md                        # Existing: Content
└── _ISSUES/                        # Existing: Issue tracking
    └── */                          # Existing: Issue folders
```

#### Multi-Section Structure

For larger documentation sites with distinct sections:

```text
your-repo/
├── index.md
├── _quarto.yml
├── docs/              # Rendered output
├── tutorials/         # Tutorial section
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── getting-started.md
│   └── advanced.md
├── reference/         # Reference section
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── api.md
│   └── cli.md
├── blog/              # Blog section (optional)
│   ├── index.md
│   └── posts/
└── assets/            # Shared resources
    ├── images/
    └── styles/
```

### 2. Configuration File (`_quarto.yml`)

The `_quarto.yml` file is the heart of your Quarto project configuration:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "Your Documentation"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: guide.qmd
        text: Guide
      - href: reference.qmd
        text: Reference

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

### 3. Source Directory (`src/doc/`)

- **Purpose**: Contains your source Markdown (`.md`) or Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) files
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use clear, descriptive filenames
  - Organize content hierarchically with subdirectories
  - Include an `index.md` as your homepage
  - Use consistent front matter (YAML headers)

### 4. Output Directory (`docs/`)

- **Purpose**: Contains the rendered HTML files that hosting platforms will serve
- **Important Notes**:
  - This directory is generated by Quarto's rendering process
  - Should be included in your repository for some hosting platforms
  - Configure your hosting platform to serve from the appropriate directory

## 🚀 Deploying the Quarto Site

Quarto sites can be deployed to multiple hosting platforms, each offering different advantages depending on your needs, budget, and infrastructure requirements.

### Popular Deployment Targets

### Quick Start Deployment

For most users, we recommend starting with **GitHub Pages** due to its simplicity:

1. **Configure `_quarto.yml`**:
```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
3. **Push changes** - automatic deployment via GitHub Actions

For detailed deployment instructions, see the specific appendixes below.

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Content Organization

- **Logical Structure**: Organize content by topic or user journey
- **Navigation**: Use clear, hierarchical navigation in your `_quarto.yml`
- **Cross-References**: Leverage Quarto's cross-referencing capabilities
- **Index Pages**: Create overview pages for each section

### 2. Writing Guidelines

- **Front Matter**: Use YAML front matter for metadata:

  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Page Title"
  description: "Brief description"
  date: "2025-01-14"
  ---
  ```

- **Code Blocks**: Use syntax highlighting and proper language specification
- **Images**: Store images in organized subdirectories, use relative paths
- **Links**: Use relative links for internal navigation

### 3. Development Workflow

1. **Write**: Create/edit Markdown files in your source directory
2. **Preview**: Use `quarto preview` for local development
3. **Render**: Run `quarto render` to generate HTML
4. **Deploy**: Push changes to trigger automated deployment
5. **Monitor**: Check deployment status and site performance

### 4. Version Control Considerations

- **Include Rendered Files**: For GitHub Pages, include the `docs/` folder in version control
- **Ignore Temporary Files**: Add to `.gitignore`:

  ```text
  .quarto/
  /.quarto/
  ```

- **Environment-Specific Configs**: Use different `_quarto.yml` files for different environments

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### 1. Themes and Styling

- **Built-in Themes**: Choose from cosmo, flatly, darkly, etc.
- **Custom CSS**: Add custom styling via CSS files
- **SCSS Variables**: Customize theme variables

### 2. Interactive Content

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Include `.ipynb` files directly
- **Observable JS**: Add interactive visualizations

### 3. Multi-language Support

- **Code Highlighting**: Support for numerous programming languages
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language documentation support

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. GitHub Pages Not Updating

- Check that the `docs/` folder is being committed
- Verify GitHub Pages is configured to serve from `/docs`
- Ensure GitHub Actions workflow is running successfully

### 2. Broken Links

- Use relative paths for internal links
- Test all links before publishing
- Use Quarto's link checking capabilities

### 3. Rendering Errors

- Check `_quarto.yml` syntax
- Verify all referenced files exist
- Review console output for specific error messages

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Analytics

- Add Google Analytics or similar tracking
- Monitor page views and user behavior
- Use hosting platform insights for performance metrics

### 2. Content Updates

- Regular review of documentation accuracy
- Update dependencies and links
- Maintain consistent style and formatting

### 3. Performance

- Optimize images for web delivery
- Minimize custom CSS and JavaScript
- Monitor page load times and Core Web Vitals

## 🎯 Conclusion

Quarto provides a powerful, flexible platform for creating professional documentation websites. By following these best practices and understanding the key concepts, you can create maintainable, beautiful documentation that automatically publishes to your chosen hosting platform whenever you update your source files.
