## Introduction 🎯

"Consistency" appears throughout documentation best practices—but what does it actually mean? It's more than using the same word twice. It's a multi-dimensional quality that spans terminology, structure, tone, formatting, and cross-references. Without a systematic approach, consistency degrades naturally as documentation grows, authors change, and conventions evolve.

This article covers:

- **Consistency dimensions** — The five levels where inconsistency hides
- **Terminology glossaries** — How to build and maintain a shared vocabulary
- **Style decision logs** — Recording choices with rationale so they stick
- **Audit checklists** — Structured approaches to finding inconsistencies
- **Automated enforcement** — Tools that catch problems before readers do
- **Cross-document patterns** — Keeping consistency across article boundaries
- **Migration strategies** — Maintaining consistency during documentation evolution

**Why consistency matters:** Inconsistent documentation erodes trust. When readers encounter "endpoint" in one paragraph and "API route" in the next, they wonder whether you're describing two different things—or simply weren't careful. Consistency reduces cognitive load and lets readers focus on content, not decoding variations.

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with [writing style principles](01-writing-style-and-voice-principles.md), [structure and information architecture](02-structure-and-information-architecture.md), and [validation and quality assurance](05-validation-and-quality-assurance.md) provides useful context.

## Dimensions of consistency 📊

Consistency isn't a single thing—it's five distinct dimensions, each requiring different strategies to manage.

### Terminology consistency

<mark>Terminology consistency</mark> means using the same word or phrase for the same concept throughout your documentation. This is the most visible and most frequently broken dimension.

**Common violations:**

| Inconsistency type | Example | Impact |
|---------------------|---------|--------|
| Synonyms | "endpoint" vs. "API route" vs. "URL" | Readers wonder if these are different things |
| Casing | "GitHub" vs. "Github" vs. "github" | Looks careless; brand names have specific casing |
| Abbreviations | "MCP" vs. "Model Context Protocol" vs. "the protocol" | First use should expand; subsequent uses should be consistent |
| Drift | Article 1 says "validation"; article 5 says "verification" | Creates confusion about whether processes differ |

**Strategy:** Build and maintain a [terminology glossary](#building-a-project-terminology-glossary) as the single source of truth.

### Structural consistency

<mark>Structural consistency</mark> means articles that serve similar purposes follow similar patterns. Readers develop expectations—when those expectations break, comprehension slows.

**What to standardize:**

- **Section ordering** — Introduction → Body → Conclusion → References (always)
- **Heading levels** — H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections, never skip levels
- **Code block format** — Always specify language; use consistent comment style
- **List formatting** — Bullet points for unordered items, numbered lists for sequences
- **Conclusion pattern** — Same structure: summary paragraph + key takeaways + next steps

**Measurement:** Compare article outlines side by side. Structural inconsistency is visible at the heading level before you read a single paragraph.

### Tonal consistency

<mark>Tonal consistency</mark> means maintaining the same voice and register across your documentation. A conversational tutorial followed by an austere reference guide feels jarring if readers move between them.

**Key tonal elements to standardize:**

- **Person** — Second person ("you") throughout, or third person if that's your convention
- **Formality level** — Contractions (it's, you'll, don't) signal conversational tone
- **Directness** — "Configure the settings" vs. "You might want to consider configuring the settings"
- **Empathy markers** — How you handle errors and warnings

**The Microsoft voice** uses warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, ready to lend a hand. If that's your standard, every article should reflect it—not just the ones written on a good day.

### Formatting consistency

<mark>Formatting consistency</mark> covers the visual presentation patterns that readers internalize unconsciously. When formatting shifts, readers notice—even if they can't articulate why.

**Elements to standardize:**

- **Emphasis patterns** — Bold for key terms, italic for definitions, `<mark>` for concepts to remember
- **Code references** — Backticks for inline code: `functionName()`, `config.json`
- **Link styling** — Descriptive text (never "click here"), consistent relative paths
- **Table design** — Introduction before tables, headers in sentence case, concise cells
- **Emoji usage** — Consistent reference classification markers (📘📗📒📕), H2 heading prefixes
- **Punctuation** — Oxford commas, em-dashes without spaces, one space after periods

### Cross-reference consistency

<mark>Cross-reference consistency</mark> means links between documents follow predictable patterns and don't break when files move.

**Standards to enforce:**

- **Link format** — Relative paths: `[Article Title](filename.md)`, not absolute URLs
- **Prerequisites** — Each article states what readers should know first
- **Navigation** — Conclusion includes "Next article" and "Related" links
- **Terminology alignment** — When article A introduces a term, article B uses the same term (not a synonym)
- **Series awareness** — Articles reference their position in the series and maintain forward/backward links

## Building a project terminology glossary 📖

A <mark>terminology glossary</mark> is your single source of truth for how concepts are named and described. Without one, consistency depends on memory—a fragile foundation.

### What belongs in a glossary

Include terms that meet any of these criteria:

- **Multiple valid names exist** — Choose one and document it (e.g., "endpoint" not "API route")
- **Abbreviations are used** — Define the expanded form and abbreviation (e.g., "MCP (Model Context Protocol)")
- **Brand-specific casing matters** — Record exact casing (e.g., "GitHub", "macOS", "VS Code")
- **Domain jargon** — Terms readers might not know (e.g., "Flesch Reading Ease")
- **Internal conventions** — Terms you've coined or redefined (e.g., "validation dimension" in this series)

### Glossary format

A practical glossary balances detail with usability. Here's a recommended format:

```markdown
## Terminology Glossary

| Term | Use This | Don't Use | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| API endpoint | endpoint | API route, URL, path | "Endpoint" for the concept; "URL" only for actual addresses |
| Diátaxis | Diátaxis | Diataxis, diataxis | Always with accent; proper noun |
| GitHub Copilot | GitHub Copilot | Copilot, copilot, GH Copilot | Full name on first use; "Copilot" acceptable after |
| MCP | Model Context Protocol (MCP) | the protocol, MCP protocol | Expand on first use per article |
| validation dimension | validation dimension | validation criteria, check type | "Dimension" is the series term |
```

### Maintaining the glossary

A glossary that isn't maintained is worse than no glossary—it gives false confidence.

**Maintenance practices:**

1. **Review during article creation** — Check the glossary before writing; add new terms as you encounter them
2. **Update during reviews** — Flag terms that don't match the glossary during peer review
3. **Audit quarterly** — Scan all articles for terms not in the glossary; add or standardize
4. **Version the glossary** — Track changes so you can see when and why terms were modified

### Glossary automation

For larger projects, automate glossary enforcement:

```yaml
# Example Vale rule: flag non-standard terminology
# .vale/styles/ProjectTerms/endpoint.yml
extends: substitution
message: "Use 'endpoint' instead of '%s'."
level: warning
swap:
  API route: endpoint
  api route: endpoint
  API path: endpoint
```

## Style decision log 📝

A <mark>style decision log</mark> records the choices you've made about your documentation style—and, critically, *why* you made them. It's the institutional memory that prevents revisiting the same debates.

### Why you need one

Without a decision log:

- New contributors re-raise settled questions ("Should we use Oxford commas?")
- Decisions get reversed accidentally during reviews
- Style drift accumulates as contributors make different assumptions
- Auditors can't distinguish intentional choices from mistakes

### Decision log format

Record each decision with enough context to be useful months later:

```markdown
## Style Decision Log

### SD-001: Oxford comma (REQUIRED)
- **Decision:** Always use the Oxford comma in lists of three or more items
- **Date:** 2026-01-14
- **Rationale:** Eliminates ambiguity in complex lists; aligns with Microsoft Writing Style Guide
- **Example:** ✅ "Red, white, and blue" — ❌ "Red, white and blue"
- **References:** [Microsoft Style Guide - Commas](https://learn.microsoft.com/style-guide/punctuation/commas)

### SD-002: Contractions (REQUIRED)
- **Decision:** Use contractions consistently throughout all articles
- **Date:** 2026-01-14
- **Rationale:** Projects warm, conversational tone per Microsoft voice principles
- **Example:** ✅ "it's, you'll, don't" — ❌ "it is, you will, do not"
- **References:** Article 01, Section "Voice and Tone"

### SD-003: Heading capitalization (sentence case ONLY)
- **Decision:** Use sentence-style capitalization in all headings
- **Date:** 2026-01-14
- **Rationale:** Easier to apply consistently; reduces decision fatigue; matches Microsoft standard
- **Example:** ✅ "Getting started with Azure" — ❌ "Getting Started With Azure"

### SD-004: Reference classification markers
- **Decision:** All references use emoji classification: 📘 Official, 📗 Verified Community, 📒 Community, 📕 Unverified
- **Date:** 2026-01-14
- **Rationale:** Communicates source reliability at a glance without requiring readers to evaluate each source
- **References:** Article 06, Section "The Reference Classification System"
```

### When to add entries

Add a style decision entry when:

- You're choosing between two or more valid approaches
- A reviewer questions a stylistic choice
- You discover an inconsistency and resolve it
- A new tool or framework introduces new terminology

## Consistency audit checklist 📋

An audit checklist transforms consistency review from a subjective activity into a structured, repeatable process.

### Pre-publication checklist

Run this checklist before publishing any article:

**Terminology:**
- [ ] All terms match the project glossary
- [ ] Abbreviations expanded on first use
- [ ] Brand names use correct casing
- [ ] No synonym drift from previous articles in the series

**Structure:**
- [ ] Follows the standard section order (Introduction → Body → Conclusion → References)
- [ ] Heading hierarchy has no skipped levels
- [ ] Code blocks specify language identifiers
- [ ] Conclusion includes Key Takeaways and Next Steps

**Tone:**
- [ ] Uses second person ("you/your") consistently
- [ ] Contractions present throughout (it's, you'll, don't)
- [ ] Active voice used as default
- [ ] Tone matches the series register

**Formatting:**
- [ ] Bold for emphasis, italic for definitions, `<mark>` for key concepts
- [ ] Inline code backticks for code elements, filenames, and commands
- [ ] Reference classification markers present (📘📗📒📕)
- [ ] Oxford commas in all lists of three or more

**Cross-references:**
- [ ] Prerequisite articles listed in Introduction
- [ ] Next Steps links point to correct articles
- [ ] All internal links use relative paths
- [ ] Related articles mentioned where relevant

### Series-level audit

Run this quarterly or after major content changes:

- [ ] All articles follow the same structural pattern
- [ ] Terminology is consistent across all articles
- [ ] Series navigation links are complete and correct
- [ ] No contradictions between articles
- [ ] Prerequisites form a logical learning path
- [ ] Metadata is up to date in all articles

## Automated consistency enforcement 🤖

Manual review catches inconsistencies—but not reliably. Automation scales consistency enforcement and catches issues before they reach readers.

### Vale: prose linting

<mark>Vale</mark> is an open-source prose linter that enforces style rules programmatically. It's the most practical tool for documentation consistency enforcement.

**Setup:**

```ini
# .vale.ini (project root)
StylesPath = .vale/styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, ProjectTerms, Microsoft
```

**Custom rule examples:**

```yaml
# .vale/styles/ProjectTerms/contractions.yml
# Enforce contractions per SD-002
extends: substitution
message: "Use contraction '%s' per SD-002."
level: warning
swap:
  it is: it's
  you will: you'll
  do not: don't
  does not: doesn't
  cannot: can't
  will not: won't
```

```yaml
# .vale/styles/ProjectTerms/heading-case.yml
# Enforce sentence case in headings per SD-003
extends: capitalization
message: "Use sentence-style capitalization in headings."
level: error
match: $sentence
scope: heading
```

```yaml
# .vale/styles/ProjectTerms/oxford-comma.yml
# Detect missing Oxford comma per SD-001
extends: existence
message: "Consider adding an Oxford comma before 'and' or 'or'."
level: warning
raw:
  - '\w+,\s\w+\s(?:and|or)\s'
scope: sentence
```

### Markdown linting

<mark>markdownlint</mark> enforces structural consistency in Markdown files:

```json
// .markdownlint.json
{
  "MD001": true,       // Heading levels increment by one
  "MD003": { "style": "atx" },  // ATX-style headings only
  "MD013": false,      // Allow long lines (common in tech docs)
  "MD024": { "siblings_only": true },  // No duplicate headings among siblings
  "MD033": false,      // Allow inline HTML (<mark> tags)
  "MD040": true,       // Code blocks must specify language
  "MD047": true        // Files must end with newline
}
```

### CI/CD integration

Enforce consistency automatically in your publishing pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/consistency-check.yml
name: Documentation Consistency
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['**/*.md']

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Vale prose lint
        uses: errata-ai/vale-action@v2
        with:
          files: '03.00-tech/'
      - name: markdownlint
        uses: nosborn/github-action-markdown-cli@v3
        with:
          files: '03.00-tech/'
```

### Custom consistency scripts

For project-specific rules that Vale can't express, write custom scripts:

```powershell
# scripts/check-terminology.ps1
# Scan articles for glossary violations

param(
    [string]$GlossaryPath = ".vale/glossary.yml",
    [string]$ContentPath = "03.00-tech/40.00-technical-writing/"
)

$violations = @()
$articles = Get-ChildItem -Path $ContentPath -Filter "*.md" -Recurse

foreach ($article in $articles) {
    $content = Get-Content $article.FullName -Raw
    
    # Check for non-standard terms
    $terms = @{
        "API route"   = "endpoint"
        "click here"  = "descriptive link text"
        "Github"      = "GitHub"
        "Diataxis"    = "Diátaxis"
    }
    
    foreach ($wrong in $terms.Keys) {
        if ($content -match [regex]::Escape($wrong)) {
            $violations += [PSCustomObject]@{
                File = $article.Name
                Found = $wrong
                Expected = $terms[$wrong]
            }
        }
    }
}

if ($violations.Count -gt 0) {
    $violations | Format-Table -AutoSize
    Write-Warning "$($violations.Count) terminology violation(s) found."
} else {
    Write-Host "No terminology violations found." -ForegroundColor Green
}
```

## Cross-document consistency patterns 🔗

Consistency within a single article is necessary but not sufficient. Documentation series—like this one—require consistency *across* articles.

### The terminology handoff pattern

When article A introduces a term, all subsequent articles should use the same term without redefining it.

**Pattern:**

1. **Introducing article** — Define the term with `<mark>` tags and explanation: "A <mark>validation dimension</mark> is a measurable aspect of documentation quality."
2. **Subsequent articles** — Use the term directly: "Apply the validation dimensions from Article 05." Don't redefine, don't use synonyms.
3. **Cross-reference** — If a reader might have skipped the introducing article, link back: "...the [validation dimensions](05-validation-and-quality-assurance.md#the-seven-validation-dimensions)..."

### The structural echo pattern

Articles within a series should echo each other's structure where it makes sense. Readers develop expectations from one article and carry them to the next.

**In this series, every main article follows:**

```
YAML frontmatter
---
# H1 Title
> Blockquote subtitle
## Table of Contents
## Introduction
  - "This article covers:" bullet list
  - Prerequisites with links
## Body Sections (H2 + H3)
## Applying [topic] to This Repository
## Conclusion
  - Summary paragraph
  ### Key Takeaways
  - **Bold takeaway** — Em-dash explanation
  ### Next Steps
  - **Next article:** link — description
  - **Related:** link — description
## References
  - Grouped by category
  - 📘📗📒📕 classification markers
<!-- Validation Metadata -->
```

When a new article breaks this pattern, consistency auditing should catch it immediately.

### The reference alignment pattern

Cross-references between articles should be bidirectional and consistent:

- If article 06 links to article 05 as a prerequisite, article 05's "Next Steps" should mention article 06
- If article 03 defines a concept used in article 07, both articles should agree on the term
- Series navigation should be complete—no orphaned articles

### Acceptable redundancy across articles

Not all cross-article overlap is a problem. Some concepts benefit from coverage in multiple articles—provided the overlap is **intentional, documented, and differentiated**.

**When redundancy is acceptable:**

| Pattern | Example | Why it's OK |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Survey → deep dive** | Art. 01 surveys readability formulas with practical targets; Art. 09 provides mathematical foundations and comprehension context | Different purpose (what vs. why); readers access different articles for different needs |
| **Definition → application** | Art. 00 defines quality criteria; Art. 05 operationalizes them into validation dimensions | Progressive depth; readers need both perspectives at different stages |
| **Brief recap → full explanation** | Art. 09 briefly recalls functional vs. deep quality from Art. 00 before extending the concept | Less than 100 words of recap that avoids forcing readers back to the original |

**When redundancy is a problem:**

- **Identical content** in two articles with no differentiation—consolidate to one location and cross-reference
- **Contradictory treatments** that give different advice for the same scenario—resolve and align
- **Drifting coverage** where both articles evolve independently, creating inconsistencies over time

**Required documentation for intentional overlap:**

When two articles deliberately cover the same concept, both articles MUST include a callout explaining the overlap:

```markdown
> **On deliberate overlap with Article [N]:** This article covers [topic]
> as a [purpose A]. Article [N] covers the same topic as a [purpose B].
> Both perspectives are intentional; see [Article 08](08-consistency-standards-and-enforcement.md
> #acceptable-redundancy-across-articles) for the series redundancy policy.
```

This prevents future editors from "fixing" intentional overlap and ensures readers understand why the same topic appears in multiple places.

### Building a concept coverage matrix

A <mark>concept coverage matrix</mark> maps which articles cover which concepts, making gaps and redundancies visible at a glance. Without one, coverage gaps only surface when a reader asks "where do I find guidance on X?" and nobody can answer.

**Matrix structure:**

| Concept | Primary article | Secondary coverage | Gap? |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|------|
| Diátaxis framework | Art. 00 | Art. 02 (progressive disclosure), Art. 05 (validation by type) | No |
| Readability formulas | Art. 01 (survey) | Art. 09 (analytical depth) | No — documented overlap |
| Functional vs. deep quality | Art. 00 (definition) | Art. 09 (measurement implications) | No — documented overlap |
| Documentation testing | Art. 05 | — | No |
| Series planning | Art. 02 | — | No |

**How to build one:**

1. **Extract concepts** — Read each article's TOC and introduction; list every distinct concept taught
2. **Assign primary ownership** — Each concept gets exactly one "home" article that provides the authoritative treatment
3. **Map secondary coverage** — Note articles that reference or recap the concept
4. **Classify overlap** — Use the [acceptable redundancy criteria](#acceptable-redundancy-across-articles) to determine if overlap is intentional or problematic
5. **Identify gaps** — Concepts that appear in no article's primary coverage represent content gaps

**Maintenance cadence:** Review the coverage matrix whenever you add, remove, or significantly restructure an article. Include it as an item in the [series-level audit checklist](#series-level-audit-checklist).

**Where to store it:** The matrix can live in a dedicated document outside the series (this repository uses `99.00-temp/` for working documents) or as a section in the series' anchor article. The important thing is that it exists and is regularly updated—not where it lives.

## Handling consistency during migration and evolution 🔄

Documentation isn't static. Terminology changes, structures evolve, and tools get replaced. Managing consistency during change is harder than establishing it initially.

### Migration strategies

When you need to change an established term or pattern:

**1. Document the change in the style decision log**

```markdown
### SD-015: Rename "API route" to "endpoint"
- **Decision:** Replace all occurrences of "API route" with "endpoint"
- **Date:** 2026-03-15
- **Rationale:** Aligns with industry-standard terminology; reduces confusion with URL paths
- **Migration:** Full find-and-replace across all articles; completed 2026-03-15
- **Previous term:** SD-007 originally allowed "API route"
```

**2. Use search-and-replace systematically**

Don't change terms article by article—you'll miss occurrences. Use `grep_search` across all files, then apply changes in one pass.

**3. Update the glossary simultaneously**

The glossary, style decision log, and article content must change together. If they get out of sync, the glossary becomes untrustworthy.

### Versioned consistency

Sometimes you need to support multiple versions of documentation simultaneously. In this case:

- **Tag each article with a version** in the validation metadata
- **Maintain separate glossaries** if terminology differs between versions
- **Document version-specific decisions** in the style decision log
- **Automate version checks** — A CI rule can verify that all articles in a version use consistent terminology

### Handling organic growth

As documentation grows organically, consistency naturally degrades. Combat this with:

- **Regular audits** — Run the [consistency audit checklist](#consistency-audit-checklist) quarterly
- **New-author onboarding** — Point new contributors to the glossary and style decision log first
- **Pre-publication review** — Every article gets a consistency review before publishing
- **Automation** — Vale and markdownlint catch common issues without human effort

## Applying consistency standards to this repository 📌

This series uses consistency standards throughout. Here's how the principles in this article apply to the Technical Documentation Excellence series:

### Repository terminology glossary

Key terms standardized across this series:

| Term | Standard usage | First defined |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Diátaxis | Always with accent mark | Article 00 |
| Validation dimension | Not "validation criteria" or "check type" | Article 05 |
| Reference classification | The 📘📗📒📕 system | Article 06 |
| Sentence-style capitalization | Not "sentence case" alone | Article 01 |
| Oxford comma | "Serial comma" is acceptable but "Oxford comma" is preferred | Article 01 |

### Structural consistency in this series

All thirteen main articles follow the [structural echo pattern](#the-structural-echo-pattern) described above. The five Microsoft Writing Style Guide sub-articles follow a different but internally consistent pattern, formally documented below.

### Sub-series structural variation: Microsoft Writing Style Guide articles

The five MS sub-articles (`microsoft-writing-style-guide/00-*.md` through `04-*.md`) are a <mark>thematic sub-series</mark>—a focused deep dive on a single external source that supplements the main series without replacing any of its articles. Their structural pattern intentionally diverges from the main series template:

```
YAML frontmatter
---
# H1 Title
> Blockquote subtitle
## Table of Contents
## Introduction
  - Scope bullets
  - Prerequisites with links to parent series
## Body Sections (H2 + H3)
  - Title Case headings
  - <mark> tags on key concepts in headings
  - No emoji prefixes
## Series Navigation
  - 5-article navigation table
  - Current article bolded
  - Related articles from parent series
## References
  - Grouped by category
  - 📘📗📒📕 classification markers
```

**Key differences from the main series template:**

| Element | Main series (Art. 00–12) | MS sub-series (MS-00–04) | Reason |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| **H2 emoji prefixes** | Required on every H2 | Not used | Sub-series predates the convention; internal consistency takes priority over retrofitting |
| **Heading capitalization** | Sentence case | Title Case | Matches the formal, reference-oriented tone of the sub-series |
| **"Applying [topic]" section** | Required | Absent | Sub-articles analyze an external guide, not repository-specific practices |
| **Conclusion section** | Required (Key Takeaways + Next Steps) | Absent | `## Series Navigation` serves as the closing section with both navigation and context |
| **`<mark>` in headings** | Not used in headings | Used for key concepts | Highlights the specific Microsoft terminology being analyzed |
| **Navigation style** | "Next Steps" within Conclusion | Dedicated `## Series Navigation` table | Sub-series is self-contained with its own 5-article navigation |

**When this variation is acceptable:**

A sub-series MAY deviate from the main structural echo pattern when ALL of these conditions are met:

1. **Internal consistency** — All articles within the sub-series follow the *same* alternate pattern
2. **Clear scope boundary** — The sub-series covers a distinct, self-contained topic (e.g., analysis of one external guide)
3. **Parent connection** — Each sub-article links back to relevant main-series articles via cross-references
4. **Documented deviation** — The structural variation is formally documented (as it is here)

If a future sub-series is added, apply these same criteria before deciding whether to use the main template or define a new variation.

### Automation in this repository

This repository uses:

- **IQPilot MCP server** — 16 tools for content validation, metadata management, and gap analysis
- **Validation prompts** — Structured prompts in `.github/prompts/` for grammar, readability, structure, and fact-checking reviews
- **Link checking** — PowerShell scripts in `scripts/` that detect broken cross-references
- **MetadataWatcher** — Automatically syncs filename changes to validation metadata

### What's not yet automated (and should be)

- Vale prose linting for terminology enforcement (configured but not yet in CI)
- markdownlint for structural consistency (available but not integrated)
- Automated glossary violation detection across the series
- Cross-reference bidirectionality checking

## Conclusion ✅

Consistency isn't a property that documentation either has or lacks—it's a multi-dimensional quality that requires deliberate systems to achieve and maintain. Terminology glossaries, style decision logs, audit checklists, and automated tooling work together to enforce consistency at scale.

### Key takeaways

- **Recognize five dimensions** — Terminology, structural, tonal, formatting, and cross-reference consistency each require different strategies
- **Build a terminology glossary** — A shared vocabulary prevents synonym drift and casing inconsistencies across your documentation
- **Log style decisions with rationale** — Record not just what you decided but why, so future contributors don't re-debate settled questions
- **Audit systematically** — Use checklists at both article and series level; don't rely on memory or intuition
- **Automate where possible** — Vale, markdownlint, CI pipelines, and custom scripts catch inconsistencies before readers do
- **Plan for change** — Migration strategies, versioned consistency, and regular audits prevent degradation as documentation evolves
