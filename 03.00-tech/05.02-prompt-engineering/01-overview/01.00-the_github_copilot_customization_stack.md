# The GitHub Copilot customization stack

GitHub Copilot's generative AI is most effective when it has access to <mark>**structured context**</mark> about your project. Both VS Code and Visual Studio let you embed that context directly in your repository using <mark>**markdown-based prompt and instruction files**</mark>. These files guide Copilot by encoding reusable prompts, coding standards, business rules, and project documentation.

This article is the series overview. It introduces every customization mechanism in the stack, explains how the pieces fit together, and points you to the concept articles, how-to guides, and reference tables where you'll find the full details. If you're new to Copilot customization, start here — then follow the reading paths at the end.

## 🏗️ How the stack fits together

Every message you type in Copilot Chat triggers a multi-layered construction process before the model sees a single token. The system prompt is built from layers of identity rules, instructions, and agent persona. The user prompt is assembled from your message, environment context, and any referenced files. The model processes both and generates a response — optionally calling tools (MCP, built-in, or extension-provided) along the way.

Each customization mechanism occupies a specific slot in this assembly:

| Mechanism | Assembly position | Activation | Persistence |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Instructions** (`.instructions.md`) | System prompt | Automatic (file-pattern match) | Every request |
| **Prompt files** (`.prompt.md`) | User prompt | On demand (`/command`) | Single invocation |
| **Agents** (`.agent.md`) | System prompt (identity override) | Agent picker | Entire session |
| **Skills** (`SKILL.md`) | System prompt (on match) | Automatic (description match) | Single request |
| **Hooks** (`.github/hooks/*.json`) | Outside the prompt | Lifecycle event trigger | Deterministic |
| **MCP servers** (`mcp.json`) | Tool schemas in system prompt | Tool call at runtime | Session |

For the full architecture with diagrams and layer-by-layer breakdown, see [How Copilot assembles and processes prompts](../03-concepts/01.02-how_copilot_assembles_and_processes_prompts.md).

---

## 📝 Prompt files

A <mark>**prompt file**</mark> is a reusable markdown document (`.prompt.md` extension) that you run as a slash command in Copilot Chat. It begins with an optional YAML header specifying metadata — name, description, agent mode, preferred model, available tools — followed by a markdown body containing the instructions or template you want Copilot to follow.

**Where they live:**

- **Workspace prompts:** `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` — recognized automatically by VS Code and Visual Studio (17.10+)
- **User prompts** (VS Code only): Stored in your VS Code profile folder, available across all workspaces

**Key features:** Variable substitution (`${selection}`, `${file}`, `${input:name}`), tool references (`#tool:githubRepo`), and model routing via the `model:` header field.

> 📘 **Concept:** [Understanding prompt files, instructions, and context layers](../03-concepts/01.03-understanding_prompt_files_instructions_and_context_layers.md)
> 🔧 **How-to:** [How to name and organize prompt files](../02-getting-started/02.00-how_to_name_and_organize_prompt_files.md) | [How to structure content for Copilot prompt files](../04-howto/03.00-how_to_structure_content_for_copilot_prompt_files.md)

---

## 📚 Custom instructions

<mark>**Custom instructions**</mark> let you define persistent rules that Copilot follows on every request — coding standards, framework preferences, output formatting, business rules. They're injected into the system prompt automatically without any manual invocation.

**Two levels:**

- **Repo-level:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — applies to the entire repository. Supported by VS Code, Visual Studio (17.10+), and SDK apps.
- **Path-specific:** `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` — each file includes an `applyTo` glob pattern (e.g., `**/*.cs`) and activates only when the user works with matching files.

**Key difference from prompt files:** Instructions are *always-on* and land in the system prompt. Prompt files are *on-demand* and land in the user prompt. This distinction affects how strongly the model follows the content — system prompt rules carry more weight.

> 📘 **Concept:** [Understanding prompt files, instructions, and context layers](../03-concepts/01.03-understanding_prompt_files_instructions_and_context_layers.md)
> 🔧 **How-to:** [How to structure content for Copilot instruction files](../04-howto/05.00-how_to_structure_content_for_copilot_instruction_files.md)

---

## 🤖 Custom agents

<mark>**Custom agents**</mark> (`.agent.md` files, VS Code 1.106+) let you define specialized AI personas with specific tools, instructions, and workflows. Each agent overrides Copilot's identity layer in the system prompt, giving the model a focused role — security auditor, documentation reviewer, database migration specialist.

**Key capabilities:**

- **YAML frontmatter** specifying tools, model preferences, and target environment (`vscode` or `github-copilot`)
- **Handoff workflows** for multi-agent orchestration — one agent completes its task and offers a button to hand off to the next
- **Subagent delegation** — agents can spawn other agents for isolated subtasks with fresh context windows
- **Visibility control** — set `user-invokable: false` to create subagent-only agents

**Important distinction:** `.agent.md` files are interactive VS Code personas. `AGENTS.md` (and `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) files are used by the GitHub coding agent for asynchronous PR creation.

> 📘 **Concept:** [Understanding agents, invocation, handoffs, and subagents](../03-concepts/01.04-understanding_agents_invocation_handoffs_and_subagents.md)

---

## 🎯 Agent Skills (preview)

<mark>**Agent Skills**</mark> (VS Code 1.107+, preview) are portable, resource-rich capabilities that work across VS Code, CLI, and the GitHub coding agent. Unlike instructions (file-pattern rules) or agents (VS Code personas), skills <mark>**bundle templates, scripts, and examples alongside instructions**</mark>.

**Key differences from other mechanisms:**

| Feature | Skills | Instructions | Prompts | Agents |
|---------|--------|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Activation** | Auto (description match) | Auto (file pattern) | On demand (`/name`) | Agent picker |
| **Resources** | Templates, scripts, examples | None | None | None |
| **Cross-platform** | VS Code, CLI, coding agent | VS Code + GitHub.com | VS Code only | VS Code only |
| **Tool control** | Limited | None | Full | Full |

Skills use <mark>**three-level loading**</mark> — name and description first (~50-100 tokens), then the SKILL.md body on match (~500-1500 tokens), then resource files only when referenced. This progressive disclosure keeps the context window lean until the skill is actually needed.

> 📘 **Concept:** [Understanding skills, hooks, and lifecycle automation](../03-concepts/01.05-understanding_skills_hooks_and_lifecycle_automation.md)
> 🔧 **How-to:** [How to structure content for Copilot skills](../04-howto/06.00-how_to_structure_content_for_copilot_skills.md)

---

## 🪝 Agent hooks (preview)

<mark>**Agent hooks**</mark> (VS Code 1.109.3+, preview) let you execute custom shell commands at key lifecycle points during agent sessions. Unlike instructions or prompts that *guide* behavior, hooks provide <mark>**deterministic, code-driven automation**</mark> with guaranteed outcomes.

**Eight lifecycle events:** `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`.

**Why hooks matter:** They're the enforcement layer. Instructions can *suggest* that the model runs tests after editing a file — hooks *guarantee* it. Common patterns include blocking dangerous commands in `PreToolUse`, running formatters in `PostToolUse`, and generating audit logs on `Stop`.

VS Code uses the same hook format as Claude Code and Copilot CLI for cross-platform compatibility.

> 🔧 **How-to:** [How to use agent hooks for lifecycle automation](../04-howto/09.00-how_to_use_agent_hooks_for_lifecycle_automation.md)

---

## 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The <mark>**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**</mark> is generally available in VS Code (1.102+). MCP provides a standardized way to connect Copilot to external data sources and tools — databases, APIs, cloud services, browser automation — using typed, narrowly-scoped tool definitions.

**MCP 1.0 features (December 2024):** Tasks (durable, resumable operations), Sampling (server-initiated LLM completions), Elicitation (server-prompted user input), and Custom Icons.

**Discovery:** Search `@mcp` in the Extensions view for the curated MCP Registry. One-click installation adds servers to your `mcp.json`. A built-in GitHub MCP Server (preview) provides repository operations without additional setup.

---

## 🧠 Models and BYOK

GitHub Copilot supports multiple model families — GPT (explicit instruction followers), Claude (clarity and context), Gemini (structured reasoning), and reasoning models (o-series, minimal prompting). Each model interprets the same prompt differently, like "different compilers" for the same source code.

VS Code 1.107 introduced the <mark>**Language Models Editor**</mark> and <mark>**bring-your-own-key (BYOK)**</mark> support. You can add models from Cerebras, OpenRouter, Ollama, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, and HuggingFace — all accessible through the Copilot model picker without consuming your subscription quota.

## 💬 Chat modes and Agent HQ

GitHub Copilot Chat provides <mark>**four built-in chat modes**</mark>:

| Mode | Description | Use case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| <mark>**Agent**</mark> | Autonomous mode that applies changes directly to your workspace | Complex multi-file refactoring, feature implementation |
| <mark>**Plan**</mark> | Creates detailed implementation plans without modifying files | Architecture planning, understanding approach before execution |
| <mark>**Ask**</mark> | Q&A mode for questions without file modifications | Learning, code explanations, debugging assistance |
| <mark>**Edit**</mark> | Direct code editing mode for targeted changes | Quick fixes, single-file modifications |

VS Code 1.107 introduced <mark>**Agent HQ**</mark>, a unified interface for managing agent sessions across three execution contexts — local (interactive), background (work tree isolation), and cloud (GitHub PR). Plan mode integrates with agent delegation: after generating a plan, you can use the **"Start Implementation"** button to hand off to any execution context.

> 📘 **Concept:** [Chat modes, Agent HQ, and execution contexts](../03-concepts/01.08-chat_modes_agent_hq_and_execution_contexts.md)

---

## 🌐 Copilot Spaces (preview)

<mark>**Copilot Spaces**</mark> (preview) let you assemble a collection of instructions, files, repositories, and web links into a shareable, persistent context that Copilot can reference across conversations. Unlike repo-level files (`.github/`, `.copilot/`), Spaces aren't tied to a single repository — they can pull sources from multiple repos, uploaded documents, and external URLs.

Use `.github/` and `.copilot/` for project-specific rules. Use Spaces for cross-project knowledge, team onboarding guides, or organizational standards.

## 🧰 GitHub Copilot SDK

The [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) (announced January 2026, technical preview) enables any application to embed Copilot's <mark>**agentic loop**</mark> outside the editor. Available for Node.js, Python, Go, and .NET, the SDK connects to the Copilot CLI running in server mode via JSON-RPC.

SDK-based applications consume the same prompt files, agent definitions, instruction files, and MCP servers documented in this series. The authoring best practices in the how-to guides apply directly — you don't need to learn a separate prompt format.

| Capability | SDK support |
|------------|-------------|
| Workspace prompt files (`.prompt.md`) | ✅ via workspace scanning |
| Instruction files (`.instructions.md`) | ✅ via workspace scanning |
| Agent definitions (`.agent.md`) | ✅ via agent definitions |
| Agent Skills (`SKILL.md`) | ✅ via agent skills |
| MCP servers | ✅ full support |
| `#file` references | ❌ no editor UI |
| Custom slash commands | ❌ no editor UI |

> 🔧 **How-to:** [How to use prompts with the GitHub Copilot SDK](../04-howto/14.00-how_to_use_prompts_with_the_github_copilot_sdk.md)

---

## 📁 Optional `.copilot/` folder

Although not part of the official specification, a <mark>**`.copilot/`**</mark> directory can hold rich project documentation and reference materials to help Copilot understand your codebase. Common subfolders include `context/` (data schemas, API contracts, code patterns), `architecture/`, `troubleshooting/`, and `examples/`.

None of these files automatically generate chat commands — they improve the semantic search that Copilot uses when answering questions about your project. Both VS Code and Visual Studio index files in `.copilot/`.

## 🎯 Conclusion

### Key takeaways

- **The customization stack has seven layers** — prompt files, instructions, agents, skills, hooks, MCP, and chat modes — each occupying a specific slot in the prompt assembly
- **Where your content lands determines how the model treats it** — system prompt content is treated as rules, user prompt content as context
- **Progressive complexity** works: start with instructions and prompt files, then add agents and skills as your workflows grow
- **Cross-platform support varies** — VS Code has the richest feature set; Visual Studio supports prompts and instructions; SDK apps consume workspace files programmatically
