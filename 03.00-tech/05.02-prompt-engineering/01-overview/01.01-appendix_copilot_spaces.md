# Appendix 01: GitHub Copilot Spaces — persistent context beyond the repository

This appendix extends [the series overview](../01-overview/01.00-the_github_copilot_customization_stack.md) by covering a context mechanism that operates **outside your repository**: <mark>GitHub Copilot Spaces</mark>. Where prompt files, instructions, agents, and MCP servers all live *inside* your codebase, Spaces let you organize context at the GitHub platform level—persistent, shareable, and independent of any single repo.

> **Feature status:** Copilot Spaces is in **public preview** as of February 2026. The feature is available to anyone with a Copilot license, including Copilot Free.

## 🎯 Why Spaces matter for prompt engineering

Throughout this series, you've learned to provide Copilot with context through repository-level files: `.github/prompts/`, `.github/instructions/`, `.github/agents/`, and MCP servers. These mechanisms work well for **project-specific** context that lives alongside the code.

But some context doesn't belong in a repository:

- **Cross-project knowledge** — Architecture decisions that span multiple repos
- **Ephemeral context** — Sprint plans, meeting transcripts, design documents that don't belong in version control
- **External references** — Pull requests, issues, uploaded documents, and images you want Copilot to reason about
- **Team onboarding** — Curated knowledge bases that help new developers get up to speed

<mark>Copilot Spaces</mark> fills this gap. A Space is a **persistent container** for context that grounds Copilot's responses in specific, curated information—without requiring that information to live in your repository.

---

## 🏗️ What a Space contains

A Space has two types of content:

### Instructions

Free-text guidance that tells Copilot what to focus on within this Space. Think of these as the Space-level equivalent of a `.instructions.md` file—they set the role, scope, and boundaries.

```markdown
You are a SQL generator. Your job is to take the sample queries
and data schemas defined in the attached files and generate SQL
queries based on the user's goals.
```

Instructions don't get indexed for search—they're injected directly into Copilot's system prompt when you chat in the Space.

### Sources

Content that Copilot uses to ground its responses. You can add four types of sources:

| Source type | What it provides | How Copilot uses it |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Files and repositories** | Code, docs, configs from GitHub repos | Searches or loads into context window |
| **Links** | URLs to pull requests, issues, other GitHub content | Fetches and references the linked content |
| **Uploaded files** | Local documents, images, spreadsheets | Loads into context window |
| **Text content** | Pasted notes, transcripts, free-form text | Loads into context window |

**Key behavior difference** between attaching a repository vs. individual files:

- **Repository**: Copilot *searches* it—it doesn't load everything into memory. Good for broad, large-scale context (e.g., "answer questions about our entire documentation").
- **Individual files**: Copilot loads the *full contents* into the context window for every query. Good for pinpointing specific documents you want Copilot to consistently prioritize.

GitHub-based sources stay **automatically in sync**. When a file changes on the `main` branch, the Space reflects the latest version.

---

## 💡 How Spaces complement repository-level files

Spaces don't replace the customization stack you've learned in this series—they add a new layer. The table below shows how each context mechanism fits into the overall picture:

| Mechanism | Scope | Lives in | Persistence | Best for |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt files** (`.prompt.md`) | Project | Repository | Versioned with code | Reusable task templates |
| **Instruction files** (`.instructions.md`) | Project or path | Repository | Versioned with code | Coding standards, project rules |
| **Agent files** (`.agent.md`) | Project | Repository | Versioned with code | Specialized assistant roles |
| **MCP servers** | Project or global | Config files | Session-based | External tool access |
| **Copilot Spaces** | Cross-project | GitHub platform | Persistent, shareable | Curated knowledge bases, onboarding, ephemeral context |

The key distinction: repository-level files are **developer-authored, code-adjacent, and versioned**. Spaces are **curator-managed, platform-level, and independent of any single codebase**.

### Practical combination patterns

**Pattern 1: Space as research context, repo files as execution rules**
A Space containing architecture documents, ADRs, and design specs grounds Copilot in *what to build*. Your repository's instruction files and agent definitions control *how to build it*.

**Pattern 2: Space for team standards, instructions for project conventions**
An org-wide Space with coding standards, review checklists, and accessibility guidelines provides the baseline. Project-level `.instructions.md` files add repo-specific conventions on top.

**Pattern 3: Space for onboarding, agents for workflows**
A "Getting Started" Space curates the documents a new developer needs. Project agents automate the actual development workflows they'll use daily.

## 🛠️ Creating and populating a Space

### Create a Space

1. Go to [github.com/copilot/spaces](https://github.com/copilot/spaces)
2. Click **Create space**
3. Name it and choose an owner (personal account or organization)
4. Add a description (optional—helps others understand the Space's purpose but doesn't affect Copilot's responses)

### Add context

Once inside the Space, add sources:

- **Add files and repositories** — Browse GitHub repos and select files, folders, or entire repositories
- **Link content** — Paste URLs to pull requests, issues, or other GitHub content
- **Upload files** — Drag in local documents, images, or spreadsheets
- **Add text** — Paste free-form notes, meeting transcripts, or specifications

You can also add files to a Space directly from the code view on GitHub—click the **Add to space** icon at the top of any file.

### Write instructions

Add instructions that define the Space's focus:

```markdown
You are an expert in our authentication system. Help developers understand
and work with our OAuth 2.0 implementation.

Focus on:
- The authentication flow defined in the API gateway docs
- Token refresh patterns from the backend service
- Error handling conventions from our coding standards

Don't make assumptions about config values—always reference the attached files.
```

## 💻 Using Spaces in your IDE

You can access Space context from any IDE that supports the GitHub Copilot extension and the GitHub MCP server.

### Prerequisites

1. Set up the [remote GitHub MCP server](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-mcp/set-up-the-github-mcp-server) for your IDE
2. Enable the Spaces toolset in your MCP configuration—it's **not included by default**

Add the `X-MCP-Toolsets` header to enable both default tools and Spaces:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "X-MCP-Toolsets": "default,copilot_spaces"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use the dedicated Spaces-only endpoint: `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/x/copilot_spaces` (this provides *only* Spaces tools, without other GitHub MCP server functionality).

### Access Space context

Spaces work in **agent mode** only, since they're accessed via MCP tools.

1. Open Copilot Chat and select **Agent** mode
2. Verify the Spaces tools are enabled: click the tools icon and confirm `get_copilot_space` and `list_copilot_spaces` appear under MCP Server: github
3. Reference the Space by name in your prompt:

```
Using the Copilot space "Checkout Flow Redesign" owned by myorganization,
summarize the implementation plan.
```

Copilot automatically uses `list_copilot_spaces` to find matching Spaces. Follow-up prompts in the same conversation have access to the same Space context without re-referencing it.

> **IDE limitation:** When using Spaces in your IDE, repository context within the Space isn't supported. You'll have access to all other sources and instructions from the Space.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration and sharing

Spaces support GitHub's permission model for sharing:

### Organization-owned Spaces

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **<mark>Viewer</mark>** | Use the Space to ask questions, view sources and instructions |
| **<mark>Editor</mark>** | Update sources, description, name, instructions (plus all Viewer permissions) |
| **<mark>Admin</mark>** | Update sharing settings, delete the Space (plus all Editor permissions) |
| **<mark>No access</mark>** | Space is hidden from other organization members |

### Personal Spaces

Personal Spaces can be shared publicly (view-only), shared with specific GitHub users, or kept private.

### Collaboration use cases

- **<mark>Onboarding</mark>**: Share a Space with code, documentation, and checklists so new developers get started faster
- **<mark>System knowledge</mark>**: Create a Space for a complex system (authentication, CI pipelines) that others can reference
- **<mark>Style guides</mark>**: Document standards and examples that Copilot references when suggesting changes
- **<mark>Accessibility reviews</mark>**: Combine internal checklists, product guidelines, and WCAG documentation into a single Space

## ⚠️ Current limitations

As a public preview feature, Spaces has some boundaries to keep in mind:

| Limitation | Impact | Workaround |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **<mark>IDE: no repository context</mark>** | Repository sources in a Space aren't available when accessed from IDE | Attach individual files instead of full repositories |
| **<mark>Agent mode only (IDE)</mark>** | Can't use Spaces in ask mode or edit mode | Switch to agent mode when you need Space context |
| **<mark>No API for automation</mark>** | Can't programmatically create or update Spaces | Use the GitHub web UI |
| **<mark>Usage counts toward limits</mark>** | Each query counts as a Copilot Chat request; premium models apply multipliers | Choose standard models for high-volume Space usage |

## 📊 When to use what: decision guide

Use this flowchart to decide which context mechanism fits your need:

```
Does this context belong in version control?
├── Yes → Is it project-specific?
│   ├── Yes → Use .instructions.md, .prompt.md, or .agent.md
│   └── No (cross-project) → Consider user-level instructions or context files
└── No → Does it need to be shared with a team?
    ├── Yes → Use Copilot Spaces (organization-owned)
    └── No → Is it ephemeral (sprint notes, transcripts)?
        ├── Yes → Use Copilot Spaces (personal)
        └── No → Use .copilot/context/ for local context
```

**Quick rules:**

- **Code conventions, project rules** → `.instructions.md` (versioned, path-scoped)
- **Reusable task templates** → `.prompt.md` (versioned, slash-command accessible)
- **External tool access** → MCP servers (configurable, session-scoped)
- **Cross-repo knowledge, onboarding, ephemeral docs** → Copilot Spaces (persistent, shareable)

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Copilot Spaces adds a platform-level context mechanism that complements the repository-level customization stack. Here are the key takeaways:

- **Spaces organize persistent context** that doesn't belong in your codebase—architecture docs, transcripts, external references, and curated knowledge bases
- **They don't replace repository-level files**—they fill the gap for cross-project and ephemeral context that prompt files, instructions, agents, and MCP servers don't cover
- **IDE access requires MCP configuration** with the `copilot_spaces` toolset explicitly enabled
- **GitHub sources stay in sync** automatically, keeping your Space context current as code evolves
- **Sharing uses GitHub's permission model**, making Spaces practical for team onboarding and collaborative knowledge management
