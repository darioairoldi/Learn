## 1. ⚡ Service Limits and Quotas

### 1.1 Transaction Rate Limits (Throttling)

**Secrets, Keys, and Certificates per vault per region:**
- **GET operations**: <mark>2,000 transactions</mark> per <mark>10 seconds</mark>
- **All other operations**: <mark>2,000 transactions</mark> per <mark>10 seconds</mark>

**Key operations (RSA 2048-bit keys):**
- **Sign/Verify**: <mark>2,000 transactions</mark> per <mark>10 seconds</mark>
- **Encrypt/Decrypt**: <mark>200 transactions</mark> per <mark>10 seconds</mark>

**Key operations (RSA 3072-bit, 4096-bit, ECC keys):**
- Lower limits apply based on key type and operation

**Impact:**
- Exceeding limits results in <mark>HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)</mark> errors
- Applications must implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- May require architecture changes for high-throughput scenarios

**Mitigation:**
- Cache secrets/keys in application memory
- Use multiple key vaults for horizontal scaling
- Implement caching strategies with appropriate TTL
- Consider Azure Key Vault Managed HSM for higher throughput requirements

---

### 1.2 Object Size Limits

**Secrets:**
- Maximum size: **<mark>25 KB**
- Impact: Cannot store large configuration files or certificates directly as secrets

**Keys:**
- RSA key sizes: <mark>**2048**, **3072**, or **4096** bits</mark>
- EC key sizes: <mark>**P-256**, **P-384**, **P-521**, **P-256K** (**secp256k1**)</mark>
- No arbitrary key sizes supported

**Certificates:**
- Maximum size: **<mark>1.5 MB</mark>**
- Includes certificate, private key, and certificate chain

**Mitigation:**
- Store large files in <mark>Azure Blob Storage</mark> and <mark>keep references/SAS tokens</mark> in Key Vault
- Split <mark>large configurations</mark> into multiple secrets
- Use certificate bundling carefully to stay within limits

---

### 1.3 Naming Constraints

**Object names (secrets, keys, certificates):**
- Length: **1-127 characters**
- Allowed characters: **0-9, a-z, A-Z, and hyphens (-)**
- Must start with a letter or number
- Case-insensitive (treated as lowercase)

**Key Vault name:**
- Length: **3-24 characters**
- Globally unique across Azure
- Alphanumeric and hyphens only
- Must start with a letter
- Cannot contain consecutive hyphens

**Impact:**
- Limited naming conventions
- Cannot use special characters or underscores
- Name collisions in global namespace

---

### 1.4 Storage Limits

**Per Key Vault:**
- **No hard limit** on number of secrets, keys, or certificates
- However, practical limits due to:
  - Performance degradation with thousands of objects
  - Management complexity
  - Listing operations pagination

**Best Practice:**
- Keep vaults focused and organized
- Use multiple vaults for different applications/environments
- Implement proper tagging and naming conventions

---

## 2. 🔒 Security and Access Limitations

### 2.1 Access Policy vs RBAC

**Access Policy Model (Classic):**
- Maximum **1,024 access policies** per vault
- Coarse-grained permissions (e.g., cannot separate read vs list for secrets)
- No inheritance from resource groups or subscriptions
- Difficult to manage at scale

**RBAC Model (Recommended):**
- Fine-grained permissions using built-in or custom roles
- Inherits from higher scopes
- Better integration with Azure AD governance
- Some operations still require vault access policies (backup/restore)

**Limitation:**
- Cannot mix both models seamlessly in some scenarios
- Migration from access policies to RBAC requires planning

---

### 2.2 Network Security Limitations

**Firewall and Virtual Network Rules:**
- Maximum **400 IP rules** per vault
- Maximum **400 virtual network rules** per vault
- No support for IPv6 (as of current version)
- Firewall rules apply to entire vault (cannot restrict per object)

**Private Endpoints:**
- Supported, but adds complexity
- DNS configuration required
- May impact multi-region scenarios
- Private endpoint connections count toward subscription limits

**Public Access:**
- Default is public access enabled
- "Deny all" firewall rules may block legitimate Azure services
- Requires careful configuration of trusted services

---

### 2.3 Soft Delete and Purge Protection

**Soft Delete:**
- Cannot be disabled on new vaults (enforced by Azure)
- Retention period: **7-90 days** (default 90)
- Deleted objects count toward naming restrictions until purged
- May cause naming conflicts when recreating objects

**Purge Protection:**
- When enabled, **cannot be disabled**
- Objects cannot be permanently deleted during retention period
- Increases storage costs for deleted objects

**Impact:**
- Cannot immediately reuse names after deletion
- Must wait for retention period or purge (if allowed)
