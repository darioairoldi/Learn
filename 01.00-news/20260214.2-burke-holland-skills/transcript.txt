Agent skills are here for Visual Studio
0:02
Code. And if you're like me, you hear
0:04
that and you think, please, please stop
0:09
making me learn new things. Please,
0:12
I just want to live my life. The good
0:14
news is agent skills are actually pretty
0:16
simple to understand and pretty
0:18
powerful. So, in this video, we're going
0:20
to jump in, take a look at what they
0:22
are, how they work. We'll build one
0:24
together, and then I'll explain the
0:25
difference between skills and prompt
0:27
files and instructions and custom
Enabling Skills
0:28
agents.
0:30
Let's do it.
0:32
So, skills at the most basic description
0:36
are just another way to provide
0:37
instructions to the model, but they have
0:41
some benefits over things like custom
0:43
instructions in that they can bundle
0:46
together scripts and templates and a
0:48
bunch of different files to define a
0:50
skill. And this doesn't make a lot of
0:52
sense until you see one in action or
0:54
build one. So, let's do that. Now, the
0:56
first thing we're going to need to do is
0:57
we're working in Visual Studio Code, but
0:59
we should point out that skills are a
1:02
spec from Anthropic, and so they work in
1:05
Claude Code and other places, but here
1:08
we're all copilot all the time. Skills
1:10
are also experimental at the time of
1:11
this recording, so there will be some
1:13
changes. Uh, but you can see here, you
1:15
just need to toggle on skills, and they
1:19
won't be on by default. So, if skills
1:20
aren't working for you, make sure you
1:22
toggle this on. Now, skills, like we
1:25
said, are just other instruction files.
1:27
That's really all they are. And so, they
1:29
just need to be in the right place. You
1:30
can put them in GitHub skills, copilot
1:33
skills, cloud skills, the cloud skills
1:36
at the root of your project. And so, for
1:38
us, since we have an empty project here,
Your First Skill
1:40
let's just start like this and create a
1:42
new folder. We'll call it GitHub. And
1:44
inside of that, we're going to put a
1:45
skills folder. And inside of that, we're
1:47
going to create a skill. And we're going
1:48
to call it the Hello World skill. Yes.
1:51
Yes. doing hello world and then inside
1:55
of this hello world folder to define our
1:58
skill we're going to create a new file
2:00
and we just call it skill.md
2:03
just a markdown file here now this file
2:06
defines the skill and there are some
2:08
things that are required in this file
2:10
and that is some metadata at the top
2:12
here so you need a name and you need a
2:15
description these things are required
2:18
for the skill you have to have them so
2:21
I've added a name and a description
2:22
here. And it's good to be descriptive as
2:24
possible with the name and the
2:26
description because of the way that
2:28
skills are loaded and used, which we'll
2:31
look at here in a second, because the
2:33
agent should be able to pick these
2:34
things up automatically when it needs
2:35
them without you having to tell it in
2:37
the chat, hey, you need to use this
2:38
skill. Now that we have the metadata
2:42
here, the next thing you want to do is
2:43
start writing the instructions that give
2:46
the skill to the model. So, let's just
2:48
start like this. We'll just say this is
2:50
the hello world skill. Use hello world
2:52
skill to respond to the user when oh and
2:56
it's fixing my grammar for me. When they
2:58
enter the phrase hello world in the chat
3:00
and then when they do that we want to uh
3:04
respond with and then we can say hello
3:07
world. This is my first skill. Yeah,
3:09
that would work. Or even better, even
3:12
more fun would be respond with um hello
3:15
world and asky art.
3:18
much more fun. So let's try this here.
3:21
Now we have created this skill. How do
3:24
we actually use this? Let's open our
3:26
chat and then in chat let's just ask the
3:28
chat what skills do you have?
3:31
And we're going to make sure this is not
3:33
attached. It is not attached. So let's
3:36
send it. And the model will look and
3:41
examine and see if it has any skills
3:43
here in the current workspace and then
3:45
should report back and tell us exactly
3:46
what those skills are. So, I have access
3:48
to domain specific skills. Hello world.
3:51
A simple skill that responds when you
3:52
enter the phrase hello world. And then
3:54
it's checking for additional skills,
3:56
which we do not have. Thank you, Claude.
3:58
You've done enough. Now, how do we
4:00
actually use this skill? Well, all we
4:03
should really have to do is say hello
4:05
world, right? Because the point of
4:07
skills is that they get picked up
4:09
automatically by the model and it knows
4:12
when to use the skill. So you can see
4:14
here it says I've read the hello world
4:16
skill instructions and we'll respond
4:18
appropriately and then we get hello
4:19
world in asy art. Not bad. That's some
4:21
pretty good ASI art. Now we could have
4:24
done this in an instructions file. Yes.
4:28
Or a prompt file. Yes. So what's special
4:31
about skills? So as we talked about
4:33
skills allow you to bundle a bunch of
4:35
different files together. So in order to
4:37
understand that we kind of need to build
4:39
something out here, make this a little
4:41
bit more complicated. So in our skill
4:43
file here, what I want to do is
4:47
uh I want to have a script here. So what
4:51
I want to do here is just uh get info
4:54
about the user's OS with OS, which is
4:58
the node package for doing that. Uh and
5:00
I'm going to use Haiku for this. I kind
5:02
of like Haiku. I think Haiku gets a bad
5:04
rap. It's fast. It's accurate. Perfect.
5:07
Okay, so look, platform type, release,
5:09
and architecture. I like it. Uh, so
5:12
let's go ahead and keep this here. And
5:14
then,
5:16
so what we could do is say, um, you
5:19
know, here's here's the workflow that we
5:21
want this thing to follow. Workflow.
5:22
Step one, um, run the following scripts
5:28
to get system information.
5:31
Respond with hello world and ask is step
5:34
two. And then step three is uh, provide
5:37
the system information obtained from the
5:39
script. So now we have kind of a
5:40
workflow here. So we should get
5:42
something a little bit more interesting
5:43
when we do our hello world. So let's try
5:45
this again. Hello world.
5:48
And now
5:51
the skill should walk through our
5:53
workflow and different do the different
5:54
things that we've defined
5:56
namely running the script in the
5:58
terminal which you can see it's doing
6:00
right here and then returning asky art
6:04
for hello world and then returning the
6:06
system information as part of the hello
6:07
world response. Let's see if we get all
6:09
that. And we do. So, here's hello world.
6:11
This is exactly what we asked for in the
6:13
skill. Now, in this format, this works
6:16
just fine because there's just not a lot
6:19
to it. But you can imagine if this was a
6:20
really long skill, like we're teaching
6:22
the AI maybe about how to write API
6:25
endpoints for our company, this could
6:27
start to get really long. And so, what
6:29
skills allow you to do is kind of
6:30
modularize. So, we're going to create a
6:31
new folder here and call it scripts. And
6:34
then inside of it, we're going to add a
6:35
new file here called get OS or get
6:39
system info.js.
6:42
And then we can add this information
6:45
here. This whole script can come out and
6:47
go into our script here, right? And then
6:52
we can reference that. You can reference
6:54
this script with relative syntax,
6:58
relative path syntax just like you would
6:59
reference a normal markdown file. So we
7:01
can say run the script like this right
7:06
and then where's the script the script
7:08
is here in scripts and then get system
7:10
info to obtain system information
7:13
respond with hello world and askard and
7:15
provide this system information obtained
7:17
from the script. So now let's run this
7:20
again
7:23
and we get the exact same thing but this
7:25
time it runs the script from the
7:27
directory instead of having an inline in
7:29
the script file. But let's take this a
7:31
step further and let's say that we want
7:33
to have a template. So I'm going to
7:35
create a new file here and we're just
7:36
going to call it template. And you don't
7:39
have to capitalize these. This is just a
7:41
pattern that you'll see a lot that you
7:43
don't have to capitalize. And then uh
7:45
here we just have uh a template for a
7:48
hello world response in chat with system
7:52
info. Let's see what co-pilot gives us
7:55
here. Hello. You've triggered the hello
7:56
world skill. Oh, look. Ask art's coming
7:59
in. I like that.
8:01
It knows that we need this. Here's your
8:03
system info. System info is here. And
8:06
then maybe like feel free to ask. Okay.
8:08
Right. So this is every time we hit
8:10
hello world, we want the model to
8:12
respond with this format and only this
8:16
format. Right? And we could do that by
8:19
coming into our skill and saying respond
8:21
with um respond with
8:26
uh the template
8:30
and then again we can just use that
8:32
relative path syntax right here and then
8:35
here we don't need this anymore. Right?
8:39
So now we are getting the operating
8:42
system info from the script. We're using
8:43
the template to define what the response
8:45
looks like. Let's give it another shot
8:47
here. All right, here we go. Hello
8:49
world.
8:51
And look at that. We get it back in
8:53
exactly the format that we defined.
8:55
Hello, you've triggered the hello world
8:56
skill. Here's the asky art. Here's your
8:58
system information. Please feel free to
9:00
ask if you need any further assistance.
9:02
Right? The models are really, really
9:03
good at following the skill and
9:05
following our template, which is exactly
9:07
what we've defined right here. So, in a
9:10
nutshell, this is what skills look like.
How skills actually work
9:14
Now you can do a lot of things here like
9:16
you could provide your database schema
9:18
in a markdown file or some other file
9:20
and pass that into the skill. You can
9:21
have multiple scripts in your skill. The
9:24
possibilities are endless. Now one of
9:27
the interesting things about skills is
9:28
that they're sort of progressively
9:30
loaded so that they don't take up a lot
9:31
of room in the context window. And in
9:33
order to understand that we need to have
9:35
a look at the chat. So let's go to our
9:38
chat debug view. And then we want to
9:40
come all the way down to the bottom and
9:41
let's take a look at our hello world
9:42
which starts right right here. Not there
9:45
but here you can see hello world. It's
9:47
continued here and then it looks like
9:48
it's continued down there. So if you
9:50
haven't watched my video on prompt files
9:53
instructions and custom agents I break
9:55
down the system prompt in that video
9:57
that that video anyway. You should watch
10:01
that. But this is the system prompt. I'm
10:03
going to scroll all the way down to the
10:04
bottom. at the very bottom. What we'll
10:07
see here is
10:10
right here
10:17
you'll see skills. Here's a list of
10:19
skills that contain domain specific
10:20
knowledge. And you can see the skill
10:22
that we get here. It's hello world. So
10:24
it's just the name and the description
10:25
and then a path to the file. So when you
10:28
pass a request to the model, any skills
10:31
you have are passed here, but none of
10:33
the other files that we've defined are
10:36
passed, nor is the body of the skill.
10:39
Only this right here gets passed on that
10:42
first agent pass. Now on the second
10:46
agent pass, let's go back to our debug
10:48
view here.
10:52
If you go if we scroll all the way down
10:53
to the bottom, we can see that the agent
10:55
responds with okay, I need to read the
10:58
skill instructions and respond
10:59
appropriately and this is the file path
11:01
that it needs to read. It wants to read
11:03
the skill.md file and it does that.
11:06
That's the very next thing it does is it
11:08
reads that file. And then if we come
11:11
down again, so we're looking at the
11:13
system prompt, the whole agent turn. So
11:15
it calls it, right? It puts it's now in
11:18
the the the prompt here as a tool call.
11:22
You can see the response from the
11:24
assistant is that it has read and now it
11:26
knows that it needs to run this uh
11:29
script to get the terminal output which
11:31
is the very next thing it does. So it's
11:32
progressively loading in these things
11:35
that it needs. So these skills are super
11:38
efficient. Uh and if we keep coming down
11:40
you can see it reads the terminal, it
11:42
reads the file. Let's go down to the
11:44
bottom of this prompt and see now it
11:47
sees this is uh this is the template.
11:49
It's now read the template and it knows
11:51
how to include this all in the response.
11:53
So you can see it's sort of like
11:54
progressively loading in these files and
11:56
executing them as it needs to. Skills
11:58
are very cool. That's how to create a
12:02
very basic skill, right? You can do this
12:04
right now. You can see they're very
12:05
simple. I want to show you a more
12:08
complex skill because the very next
12:09
question you should be asking is well
12:12
when should I use the skill. Let me show
12:15
you. So technically speaking there isn't
12:17
anything that the agent can't do because
12:22
it can run any command in your terminal.
12:24
So technically it can do anything but
12:26
there are things that it doesn't know
12:27
how to do that it will try to figure out
12:29
how to do and it may or may not get
12:30
those things right. So, for instance,
12:33
I've added a PDF file here. And this PDF
12:36
file is for the Logitech MX
12:40
console, which is pull up here so you
12:43
can see it. It's this thing here. Very
12:46
handy. Should pick one of those up.
12:48
They're very nice. Now, I want to see
12:51
what's inside this file. And so, if we
12:53
ask the AI to do this, we could just
12:55
say, what is in this file here? And if
12:59
we send this prompt, let's actually see
13:02
what happens. And I'm using Opus 45,
13:04
which I consider to be currently the
13:06
most capable model for coding here.
13:10
So it looks like it's found the file.
13:12
It's going to try to read it, but it
13:14
can't. So essentially, there is no
13:16
support for PDFs here. So what we can do
13:19
is use a skill to teach Copilot and
13:23
Claude how to read PDFs. Now, how do we
13:26
do that? Well, we could build our own
13:28
skill or we can use some of the ones
13:30
that already exist. So, if you go to the
13:32
awesome co-pilot repo here on GitHub,
13:35
github.com/github/awesomecopilot,
13:38
there are some skills here and this list
13:42
is growing. And then the other place is
13:44
if you go to anthropic/skills,
13:47
github.com/anthropic/skills.
13:50
And you can see there's a few more in
13:51
here. And we're going to use this PDF
13:53
skill here. So, I've cloned that repo to
13:56
my local machine. So, I'm going to copy
13:58
in the PDF skill
14:01
from there. I I cloned the repo and then
14:04
I just copied in the PDF skill here. So,
14:06
you can see it's right here. And you
14:08
should recognize this format now after
14:09
this video. So, we have the skill.md
14:11
file. Here's the metadata here. And then
14:13
you can see it's quite long. Uh there's
14:15
a lot of different scripts in here.
14:17
There's scripts in here, right? There's
14:18
all kinds of PDF support here, not just
14:20
reading PDFs, but it teaches the agent
14:24
how to work with PDFs. So, now let's go
14:26
back and try our prompt again now that
14:29
we have this PDF skill and see what the
14:32
experience is like now that we've taught
14:34
the agent how to work with PDFs.
14:37
And you can see it used the scripts and
14:39
the skill to use some Python to extract
14:41
the PDF contents here. And now it knows
14:44
what the PDF is. and we can just pass
14:46
PDFs with our prompts. Now, right, we've
14:49
taught the agent a new skill with
14:52
skills. Now, that's how you build skills
14:55
and use them. Let's talk for just a
14:57
second about when to use instruction
14:59
files versus prompt files versus custom
15:01
agents versus skills. So, admittedly,
15:04
agents are new and we're sort of still
15:07
figuring out where everything fits
15:08
together. We've come up with a lot of
15:11
different ways of passing instructions
15:12
to models and some of this stuff was
15:14
invented before skills and skills take
15:17
the place of some of those things. But I
15:19
think generally speaking, you can think
15:21
about it like this. If you have
15:23
instructions that you need to pass with
15:24
every single prompt to the model, like
15:27
general information about the project,
15:29
that should be an instructions file. If
15:31
you have a short prompt that you find
15:34
yourself reusing a lot, that should be a
15:36
prompt file. If you want to tweak the
15:39
way that the agent behaves, in other
15:42
words, you want to define specific
15:44
workflows that you want it to follow
15:46
every single time, that's a custom
15:49
agent. Everything else is probably a
15:54
skill. But again, remember that all of
15:57
these are just building blocks to help
15:59
you build out workflows that work for
16:01
you and your team. There isn't really a
16:03
right or wrong way to use these things.
16:06
They're just different tools that you
16:08
have in your toolbox to build out the
16:10
optimal workflow. That's the new agent
16:12
skills support in Visual Studio Code.
16:15
It's available today in VS Code Insiders
16:18
and Stable. Make sure that you look for
16:20
that experimental setting and turn that
16:21
on and you can start using them right
16:24
away. Thanks for watching. And as
16:26
always,
Using pdf skill
16:28
happy coding.
